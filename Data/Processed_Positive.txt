however	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	osteogenesis	be	yet	to	be	know	
since	<RNA_Name>	and	-204	<Number>	be	know	as	runx2-targeting	mirnas	these	observation	also	imply	that	<Protein_Name>	may	modulate	the	cellular	level	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	via	in	part	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	-204	<Number>

furthermore	during	mouse	liver	development	cat-1	mrna	decrease	in	an	almost	inverse	correlation	with	<RNA_Name>	
eight	potential	<RNA_Name>	targetsites	be	predict	within	the	human	cat-1	mrna	with	six	in	the	3'-untranslated	region	
in	summary	these	study	follow	the	accumulation	during	development	of	<RNA_Name>	from	its	mrna	precursor	<Protein_Name>	through	to	identification	of	what	may	be	a	specific	mrna	target	cat-1

these	primary	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	might	downregulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	downregulates	<Protein_Name>	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	and	that	<RNA_Name>	positively	regulate	proliferation	of	hacat	cell	in	vitro	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	autophagosome	formation	as	indicate	by	the	decreased	number	of	green	fluorescent	protein	-lc3	puncta	in	addition	both	lc3-i	and	lc3-ii	detection	and	bafilomycin	a1	assay	support	that	<RNA_Name>	block	the	conversion	of	lc3-i	to	lc3-ii	which	be	require	for	the	elongation	of	the	phagopore	and	in	turn	the	formation	of	the	autophagosome

these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	and	caspase-3	gene	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	b	
in	this	study	we	focus	on	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	which	be	predict	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	and	demonstrate	that	these	micrornas	directly	targetthe	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	and	inhibit	invasion	apoptosis	and	proliferation	of	glioblastoma

these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	glioblastoma	cell	
therefore	the	effect	on	invasion	by	restoration	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	similar	with	the	effect	by	downregulation	of	the	proved	direct	<Protein_Name>	target	
we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	<RNA_Name>	target	in	crc	and	show	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	down-stream	target	
knock-down	of	<Protein_Name>	mimic	the	phenotype	induce	by	<RNA_Name>	over-expression	indicating	that	<RNA_Name>	most	likely	exert	its	pro-apoptotic	role	through	<Protein_Name>	and	its	anti-apoptotic	down-stream	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
here	we	report	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	<Protein_Name>	oncogene	and	function	as	a	tumor-suppressing	mirna	in	pancreatic	cancer	cell	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	recognize	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	translation	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	regulate	cell	proliferation	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
mechanistic	investigation	reveal	that	oridonin	upregulated	bim-s	by	diminish	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	mitochondria-dependent	apoptosis	
among	them	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	by	anti-mirna-19a	transfection	show	a	positive	therapeutic	effect	in	bladder	cancer	cell	by	inhibit	cell	growth	and	induce	cell	apoptosis	target	<Protein_Name>	through	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	pathway

inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	a	significant	upregulation	of	the	chemokine	receptor	<Protein_Name>	in	both	endothelial	cell	and	smooth	muscle	cell	
inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	also	lead	to	an	upregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	macrophage	and	of	<Protein_Name>	in	macrophage	and	<Protein_Name>	cell	
moreover	we	observe	upregulation	of	the	select	target	gene	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	the	carotid	artery	of	mouse	treat	with	gso-494	
take	together	these	finding	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	affect	the	level	of	secrete	<Protein_Name>	far	suggesting	that	the	mirna	be	able	to	repress	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	vitro	in	summary	we	find	that	out	of	a	panel	of	six	mirnas	target	<Protein_Name>	only	<RNA_Name>	level	be	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	express	high	level	of	<Protein_Name>	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	dysregulation	could	contribute	to	the	observe	elevated	<Protein_Name>	level	in	<Protein_Name>	
these	reporter	vector	carry	mutation	in	the	target	site	be	insensitive	to	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	mir-28-a	and	<RNA_Name>	proving	that	the	modification	of	the	target	site	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	able	to	block	the	function	of	these	mirna	
furthermore	bioinformatic	prediction	and	experimental	validation	reveal	that	the	anti-tumor	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	be	probably	exert	through	target	and	repress	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
<Protein_Name>	be	up-regulated	in	osteosarcoma	cell	line	and	primary	tumor	sample	and	the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	negatively	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	level	in	osteosarcoma	tissue	
enforced	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	remarkably	reduce	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	reporter	gene	with	the	wild-type	construct	but	not	with	the	mutant	l1cam3'utr	construct	indicate	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
these	finding	indicate	that	dicer-1	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>

<RNA_Name>	promote	apoptosis	of	dc	by	target	bcl-2	
overall	<RNA_Name>	be	negatively	correlate	with	il-12p35	mrna	expression	suggest	post-transcriptional	regulation	of	il12p35	by	<RNA_Name>	
as	show	in	<Protein_Name>	6c	<RNA_Name>	mimic	suppress	bcl-2	mrna	and	protein	expression	in	bcg-infected	bmdcs	while	the	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	show	the	opposite	effect	reveal	an	inverse	correlation	between	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	
far	we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
sustain	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	without	change	mrna	level	and	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	increase	<Protein_Name>	in	conclusion	our	study	reveal	a	molecular	link	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	present	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	critical	therapeutic	targetin	breast	cancer	
<Protein_Name>	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	at	the	mir-155-foxo3a	response	element	to	repress	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
these	include	mir-	125a	and	<RNA_Name>	show	to	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	but	not	in	prostate	cancer	cell	<RNA_Name>	which	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	breast	cancer	cell	and	<RNA_Name>	which	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	by	virtue	of	its	specific	binding	to	two	separate	targetsites	
here	we	show	that	tumor	suppressor	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	repress	its	expression	
this	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	partly	account	for	the	upregulation	of	tgf-beta1	and	tgf-betarii	because	our	data	establish	tgf-beta1	and	tgf-betarii	as	target	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	repression	
we	subsequently	evaluate	the	ability	of	<RNA_Name>	to	repress	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	of	<RNA_Name>	to	repress	tgf	--	betarii	expression	
moreover	luciferase	assay	confirm	the	direct	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	on	protein	kinase	c	<Protein_Name>	and	heat	shock	protein	<Number>	
these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	this	study	we	experimentally	establish	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	mouse	which	be	in	line	with	the	detrimental	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	heart	
moreover	<RNA_Name>	can	inhibit	epididymal	cell	proliferation	by	target	<Protein_Name>	in	vitro	
<RNA_Name>	may	inhibit	epididymal	epithelial	cell	proliferation	during	postnatal	epididymal	development	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
therefore	we	further	examine	whether	the	alteration	in	<RNA_Name>	expression	indeed	have	an	effect	on	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
as	show	in	figure	4a	and	b	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	at	both	mrna	and	protein	level	
furthermore	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	markedly	abolish	the	induction	of	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	with	<Number>	gy	irradiation	
moreover	though	addition	of	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	as	well	as	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	reduce	cell	survival	rate	the	combination	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	transfection	and	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	neutralizing	antibody	treatment	lead	to	a	cell	survival	fraction	that	be	comparable	to	that	of	the	non-treated	control	suggest	an	interplay	exist	between	<RNA_Name>	and	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	
the	<RNA_Name>	level	show	an	inverse	correlation	with	cox-2	protein	expression	in	all	<Number>	cell	line	
cox-2	as	a	direct	target	for	<RNA_Name>	regulation	be	determine	by	use	a	luciferase	reporter	assay	
the	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	do	not	affect	cox-2	mrna	transcription	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	cox-2	protein	expression	by	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	cox-2	mrna	
interestingly	the	inhibitory	function	of	<RNA_Name>	on	cox-2	expression	can	be	reverse	by	introduction	of	the	3'utr	fragment	of	cox-2	
cox-2	protein	level	be	significantly	low	in	bph1cmir101	cell	than	in	bph1cvec	cell	however	the	protein	level	of	cox-2	in	bph1cmir101	cell	be	significantly	recover	by	introduce	3'utr	of	cox-2	fragment	in	conclusion	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	cox-2	protein	expression	by	specifically	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	the	cox-2	mrna	region	
in	particular	we	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	not	only	a	direct	target	of	<Protein_Name>	repression	but	that	<Protein_Name>	also	induce	two	mirs	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	which	specifically	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	to	further	regulate	its	expression	
we	observe	similar	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	construct	activity	in	mda-mb-231	cell	a	second	breast	cancer	line	know	to	express	high	level	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	observation	suggest	that	the	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	'	-utr	contain	functional	binding	site	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	together	the	level	of	these	two	mirs	contribute	to	the	overall	level	of	<Protein_Name>	within	the	cell	
together	these	finding	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	act	to	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	level	both	directly	through	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	transcription	and	indirectly	through	the	induction	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	that	then	target	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
the	identifiction	of	the	<Protein_Name>	regulator	be	by	systematically	inactivation	the	salmonella	homologues	of	conserve	e	coli	enterobacteria	srna	gene	and	compare	the	<Protein_Name>	level	of	the	result	mutant	with	those	of	wild-type	and	<Protein_Name>	mutate	salmonella	
only	<Protein_Name>	be	pursue	as	the	candidate	srna	responsible	for	negative	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	synthesis	then	
upregulationof	<Protein_Name>	as	a	result	of	<RNA_Name>	downregulation	have	be	observe	during	hcc	development	
<RNA_Name>	may	participate	in	hbv-induced	epigenetic	modification	through	<Protein_Name>	
here	we	validate	scd-1	as	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	use	a	dual	luciferase	assay	
this	study	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	lipogenesis	by	target	scd-1	therefore	<RNA_Name>	might	be	apply	in	therapy	of	lipid	metabolism	disorder	
herein	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	could	inhibit	scd-1	expression	by	target	the	3-	-untranslated	region	of	its	mrna	thus	affect	lipogenesis	and	fat	composition	of	porcine	adipocytes	
thus	scd-1	be	confirm	as	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
our	luciferase	assay	result	show	significantly	decrease	luciferase	activity	of	pgl3-scd-1	3'utr	versus	control	with	no	change	of	pgl3-scd-1	3'utr-mut	and	pgl3-scd-1	3'utr-del	which	prove	that	<RNA_Name>	may	act	on	scd-1	by	target	seed	sequence	in	the	3'utr	
recent	study	identify	<RNA_Name>	as	a	major	downstream	target	of	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	also	target	of	mir-141-200c	cluster	
interestingly	several	essential	component	of	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	complex	namely	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	predict	target	of	the	mir-141-200c	cluster	
<Protein_Name>	have	one	<RNA_Name>	targetsite	and	one	<RNA_Name>	targetsite	while	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	have	two	<RNA_Name>	targetsites	
<Protein_Name>	have	one	<RNA_Name>	targetsite	
although	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	less	obviously	affect	by	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	panc-1	cell	as	compare	to	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	we	observe	a	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	on	the	protein	level	when	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	be	transiently	transfected	in	panc-1	cell	4d	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	also	target	of	the	mir141-200c	cluster	
these	observation	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	directly	to	the	3'utr	of	shmt1mrna	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
<RNA_Name>	suppresses	cell	proliferation	enhances	cell	apoptosis	and	cause	cell-cycle	arrest	in	lung	adenocarcinoma	by	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
piglet	bear	to	betaine-supplemented	sow	demonstrate	a	significant	up-regulation	in	the	hepatic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	which	be	predict	to	target	<Protein_Name>

such	a	study	reveal	that	this	mirna-induced	knockdown	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	within	normal	human	blood	mononuclear	cell	be	responsible	for	the	suppression	of	gene	cod	for	bcl-2	c-myc	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
luciferase	assayand	transfection	confirm	<RNA_Name>	binding	to	3'utr	of	prostaglandin-endoperoxidase	synthase	<Number>	mrna	and	<RNA_Name>	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	amcs	
figure	3mir-143	binding	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	level	however	in	both	aec	and	amcs	be	not	significantly	change	by	<RNA_Name>	transfection	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	occur	largely	by	translational	inhibition	than	by	<Protein_Name>	mrna	degradation	in	the	amnion	particularly	in	amcs	
the	activity	of	mcl-1	3'utr	reporter	be	inhibit	by	co-transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	
<RNA_Name>	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	synthesis	by	an	antisense	mechanism	that	involve	direct	base-pairing	to	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	would	markedly	reduce	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	its	downstream	phosphorylated	protein	
similar	to	restore	<RNA_Name>	expression	<Protein_Name>	down-regulation	suppress	cell	viability	and	increase	cell	apoptosis	whereas	restoration	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	significantly	reverse	the	<RNA_Name>	antitumor	activity	and	the	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	p-4e-bp1	p-s6k1	signal	pathway	profile	in	clinical	specimen	and	cell	line	<Protein_Name>	be	commonly	overexpressed	and	its	protein	level	be	statistically	inversely	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	expression	
genetic	screen	of	randomly	insert	<Protein_Name>	translational	fusion	experiment	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	repress	by	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	partially	sigmas-dependent	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	affect	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	the	mrna	as	well	as	the	protein	level

this	result	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
this	indicate	that	the	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	mimic	the	function	of	<RNA_Name>	on	myogenic	differentiation	of	c2c12	cell	far	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	myogenic	differentiation	by	downregulating	<Protein_Name>

the	present	study	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	and	inhibit	its	expression	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	suggest	that	the	deregulation	of	mir-195-mediated	<Protein_Name>	inhibition	may	serve	as	a	general	mechanism	in	the	development	of	a	variety	of	cancer

in	this	study	we	find	that	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	be	regulate	by	transfected	<RNA_Name>	synthetic	
the	lactogenic	activity	of	gh	may	be	elicit	directly	through	the	activation	of	<Protein_Name>	follow	by	the	activation	of	milk	protein	gene	transcription	in	alveolar	cell	so	we	suggest	that	the	operative	mechanism	be	that	<RNA_Name>	deregulate	<Protein_Name>	affect	jak2-stat5	signal	pathway	and	decrease	the	expression	of	-beta-casein	
the	present	study	show	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	confirm	the	prediction	by	bioinformatics	that	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	could	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	evidence	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	human	ec	behavior	through	target	<Protein_Name>	as	well

mechanistically	we	find	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	osteosarcoma	cell	while	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	increase	<Protein_Name>	expression	
take	together	our	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	inhibit	osteosarcoma	growth	via	the	down	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	result	suggest	that	the	tumor	suppressor	activity	of	<RNA_Name>	be	mediate	through	negative	regulation	of	oncogenic	protein	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	suppressed	luciferase	activity	significantly	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	lead	to	the	change	of	firefly	luciferase	translation

interestingly	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	which	be	more	highly	induce	by	h5n1	than	by	h1n1	have	an	ability	to	suppress	the	expression	of	a	cytokine	-	transforming	growth	factor	-beta2	since	tgf-beta2	be	an	important	cytokine	that	can	act	as	both	an	immunosuppressive	agent	and	a	potent	proinflammatory	molecule	through	its	ability	to	attract	and	regulate	inflammatory	molecule	and	previous	report	show	that	only	seasonal	influenza	h1n1	could	induce	a	persistent	expression	of	tgf-beta2	we	speculate	that	the	modulation	of	tgf-beta2	expression	by	different	influenza	subtypes	via	<RNA_Name>	might	be	a	critical	step	for	determine	the	outcome	of	either	normal	or	excessive	inflammation	progression	
the	result	of	a	dual-luciferase	activity	assay	use	the	3'utr	of	apaf-1	also	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	significantly	decrease	the	expression	of	luciferase	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'utr	of	apaf-1	
real	time	pcr	array	for	ratapoptotic	gene	computational	targetgene	analysis	and	luciferase	reporter	assay	identify	flice-associated	huge	protein	caspase-8-associated	protein-2	in	<Protein_Name>	as	the	targetgene	of	<RNA_Name>	
our	in	silico	search	result	in	a	consensus	putative	targetsite	of	<RNA_Name>	relevant	to	apoptosis	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	result	clearly	show	that	flash	<Protein_Name>	play	an	important	role	in	apoptosis	as	a	downstream	target	of	hypoxia-induced	<RNA_Name>	during	ip	of	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	
here	we	show	a	striking	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	family	mirnas	during	murineaortic	development	withcommensurate	down-regulation	of	target	include	<Protein_Name>	and	other	extracellularmatrix	gene	
these	result	confirm	previous	observation	that	the	3'utr	of	murineeln	be	a	<RNA_Name>	target	and	additionally	show	that	the	multiple	<RNA_Name>	mres	act	synergistically	
the	second	construct	additionally	contain	four	<RNA_Name>	mres	and	be	significantly	responsive	to	both	mirna	precursor	indicate	a	specific	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	mres	in	the	<Protein_Name>	of	murineeln	
in	addition	<Protein_Name>	have	neither	<RNA_Name>	nor	<RNA_Name>	mres	in	its	3'utr	and	be	responsive	to	both	<Protein_Name>	mimic	
although	<Protein_Name>	have	one	<RNA_Name>	and	one	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	in	its	3'utr	the	great	majority	of	mres	for	these	mirnas	be	locate	in	its	<Protein_Name>	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	significantly	high	in	hcc	tissue	but	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	obviously	low	
subsequently	<Protein_Name>	be	identify	as	a	target	of	mirna-184	by	bioinformatics	and	dual	luciferase	assay	
additionally	we	also	prove	that	<RNA_Name>	silencing	inhibit	cellular	proliferation	by	over	express	<Protein_Name>	and	induced	hepg2	apoptosis	by	caspase	<Number>	<Number>	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	cell	growth	and	invasion	and	induces	cell	apoptosis	and	cycle	arrest	through	repress	<Protein_Name>	gene	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	might	be	use	as	a	biomarker	or	therapeutic	target	for	the	treatment	of	gastric	cancer	
in	our	study	we	find	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	affect	neuron	survival	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
the	inverse-correlated	expression	profile	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	also	indicate	that	mirnas-regulated	<Protein_Name>	pathway	may	play	different	role	during	the	progression	of	brain	injury	induce	by	a-beta	deposition	
<RNA_Name>	could	directly	target	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	to	downregulate	the	expression	
further	study	suggest	that	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	could	phenocopied	function	of	the	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	in	mda-mb-231	cell	overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	could	counteract	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	the	proliferation	and	invasion	
here	for	the	first	time	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	its	family	member	directly	target	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	receptor	ii	to	enhance	ipsc	generation	
to	determine	whether	mouse	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	target	by	mir-	<Number>	and	mir-	106b	<Protein_Name>	mimic	be	transfected	into	mefs	and	total	cell	lysates	be	analyse	by	western	blot	<Number>	h	later	
indeed	mir-	<Number>	and	mir-	106b	expression	efficiently	decrease	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	be	decrease	by	5-	<Number>	while	<Protein_Name>	be	decrease	by	60-	<Number>	
figure	<Number>	mir-	<Number>	and	mir-	106b	directly	target	mouse	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
tgf-beta	receptor	ii	be	also	overexpressed	in	mefs	and	<Protein_Name>	enhancement	by	mir-	106b	be	compromise	under	such	condition	
altogether	our	data	identify	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	target	of	mir-	<Number>	and	mir-	106b	and	down	regulation	of	these	gene	can	enhance	the	reprogramming	process	
these	mirnas	enhance	reprogramming	in	a	manner	similar	to	that	see	with	the	mir-	106b	<Number>	cluster	and	transfection	of	these	mirs	result	in	decreased	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	as	well	as	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	result	thus	suggest	a	negative	correlation	between	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	5p	during	the	differentiation	of	mescs	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	the	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	by	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	dna	damage	repair	and	cell	proliferation	of	mescs	through	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	have	be	report	to	have	a	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	within	its	3'-untranslated	region	
when	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	add	in	vitro	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	greatly	diminished	
<RNA_Name>	bind	to	the	ribosome	bind	site	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	follow	by	translational	inhibition	could	explain	this	result	
as	show	<RNA_Name>	basepairing	to	the	<Protein_Name>	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	could	potentially	prevent	ribosome	biding	
the	complementarity	between	base	-2	-3	and	-6	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	base	<Number>	<Number>	and	<Number>	of	<RNA_Name>	seem	to	be	essential	for	their	interaction	
it	should	be	note	that	this	regulatory	cascade	do	not	entail	a	direct	action	of	<Protein_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
gsk-3-beta	messenger	rna	be	identify	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	computational	analysis	and	experimental	assay	
mir-26a-mediated	reduction	of	gsk-3-beta	result	in	activation	of	-beta-catenin	and	induction	of	several	downstream	gene	include	c-myc	<Protein_Name>	and	peroxisome	proliferator-activated	receptor	-beta	
this	approach	lead	us	to	identify	<RNA_Name>	as	a	noncoding	rna	that	directly	bind	the	3-	-untranslated	region	of	the	gsk-3-beta	mrna	
these	result	demonstrate	that	gsk-3-beta	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
our	finding	be	consistent	with	a	recent	study	by	mohamed	et	al	show	that	<RNA_Name>	target	gsk-3-beta	in	human	airway	smooth	muscle	cell	
dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	show	that	<RNA_Name>	interact	with	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	gst-	
compare	to	control	the	mrna	and	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	gst-	be	downregulated	after	<RNA_Name>	transfection	and	upregulated	after	anti-mir-133b	transfection	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	wild	type	gst-	
this	inhibitory	effect	of	il-10	on	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	an	increase	in	the	expression	of	the	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
the	fact	that	lps	potently	induces	mature	<RNA_Name>	suggest	that	as	<RNA_Name>	expression	increase	its	ability	to	bindto	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	should	result	in	a	decrease	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	
furthermore	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	exert	its	role	by	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	be	correlate	with	down-regulation	of	its	target	<Protein_Name>	and	up-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
irs-2	be	one	of	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	inhibit	the	-beta-cell	proliferation	through	irs-2	instead	of	irs-1	
<RNA_Name>	may	take	part	in	the	glucose	homeostasis	both	through	its	target	irs-2	and	irs-1	
this	result	demonstrate	that	the	three	nucleotide	uac	be	crucial	for	the	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	with	the	irs-2	
in	general	the	above	result	indicate	that	irs-2	be	one	of	the	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
together	with	the	up-regulation	wave	of	the	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	the	expression	of	irs-2	and	irs-1	mrna	display	a	different	mode	of	change	
we	find	that	in	both	cortical	precursor	and	their	neuronal	progeny	<Protein_Name>	antisense	rna	contributes	to	post-transcriptional	down-regulation	of	its	sense	partner	possibly	by	a	dicer-promoted	mechanism	interestingly	
remarkably	knock-down	of	<RNA_Name>	induce	by	mir-alphaemx2os-774	rescue	the	emx2-mrna	decrease	to	large	extent	suggest	that	emx2os-ncrna	substantially	contribute	to	<Protein_Name>	down-regulation	at	the	time	when	cp	neuron	be	bear	
first	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	a	crucial	transcriptional	factor	involve	in	anti-stress	response	down	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	release	the	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	translation	and	lead	to	increase	<Protein_Name>	protein	content	
all	consider	these	data	support	a	direct	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	through	a	posttranscriptional	mechanism	at	its	3'utr	
we	here	present	a	novel	function	of	<RNA_Name>	in	protect	cell	from	oxidative	stress-associated	cell	death	through	interlink	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	signal	in	erythroid	cell	
several	micrornas	include	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	dysregulated	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	treat	with	as2o3	the	
expression	of	caspase-3	and	<Protein_Name>	which	be	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	respectively	be	up-regulated	in	as2o3	treat	cell	
use	a	luciferase	assay	we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
inaddition	we	find	that	exogenous	over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	pancreatic	cancer	cell	growth	both	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	and	that	sirna-mediated	silencing	of	<Protein_Name>	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	similarly	inhibits	pancreatic	cancer	cell	growth	
to	test	this	hypothesis	we	use	a	luciferase	assay	and	by	do	so	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	indeed	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
meanwhile	we	also	demonstrate	that	gm-csf	be	a	main	inducer	of	<RNA_Name>	in	tumor	environment	and	<RNA_Name>	in	turn	promote	the	expansion	and	immune	suppressive	activity	of	mdscs	via	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	homolog	and	friend	of	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	which	can	lead	to	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	activation	
here	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	whose	genomic	locus	be	locate	in	fragile	region	within	two	chromosomal	cluster	include	mir-200c-141	cluster	and	mir-200b-200a-429	cluster	strongly	promote	the	suppressive	potential	of	mdscs	via	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	lead	to	subsequent	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	activation	
importantly	the	mutation	in	the	putative	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	abolish	the	repression	by	<RNA_Name>	demonstrating	that	<RNA_Name>	could	specifically	target	their	binding	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	and	reduce	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	mdscs	
these	data	support	the	notion	that	over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	301a	<Number>	lead	to	<Protein_Name>	down-regulation	thus	inhibit	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	signaling-mediated	cell	growth	suppression	which	contribute	to	the	development	of	colon	cancer	
these	result	far	demonstrate	that	the	growth-promoting	role	of	<RNA_Name>	301a	<Number>	be	mainly	through	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
in	western	blot	and	luciferase	assay	<Protein_Name>	be	identify	as	a	major	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
moreover	we	also	find	that	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	lacking	in	3'utr	could	abrogate	the	anti-migration	and	pro-apoptosis	function	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	finding	suggest	the	importance	of	<RNA_Name>	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	in	the	regulation	of	growth	migration	and	apoptosis	of	gc	improve	our	understanding	of	the	mechanism	of	gc	pathogenesis	and	may	promote	the	development	of	novel	target	therapy	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	repressed	expression	of	bcl-2	
transfection	of	the	mutant	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	with	the	same	construct	have	no	effect	on	luciferase	activity	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	show	a	slight	reduction	in	<Protein_Name>	expression	when	<RNA_Name>	be	overexpressed	as	compare	with	the	luciferase	shrna	control	vector	
as	in	the	western	blot	analysis	when	<RNA_Name>	be	overexpressed	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	decrease	by	approximately	<Number>	as	compare	with	the	luciferase	shrna	control	
collectively	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	
<RNA_Name>	target	the	mrna	of	the	tumor-suppressor	protein	<Protein_Name>	
we	inhibit	mir-142-	5p	and	<RNA_Name>	in	thp-1	cell	use	antagomir	oligonucleotides	and	measure	the	expression	of	six	pyrogen	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	pge2	by	rt-qpcr	4d	of	these	three	target	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	pge2	be	express	at	level	below	the	detection	limit	of	rt-qpcr	pre-	and	post-knockdown	of	either	mirna	
we	confirm	that	mir-142-	5p	and	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	respectively	4d	
important	antiapoptotic	bcl-2	be	identify	to	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	far	suggest	to	exert	its	<Protein_Name>	function	mainly	through	target	bcl-2	expression	
take	together	these	experiment	provide	clear	and	strong	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	act	as	a	physiological	regulator	in	mouse	adult	sensory	neuron	to	maintain	gsk3-beta	at	a	low	level	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	gsk3-beta	be	the	major	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	adult	mouse	sensory	neuron	that	function	to	control	axon	regeneration	
therefore	the	result	here	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	control	axon	regeneration	via	gsk3-beta	by	target	gene	expression	at	the	neuronal	soma	
<RNA_Name>	increase	tumor	necrosis	factor-related	apoptosis-inducing	ligand	sensitivity	in	non-small	cell	lung	cancer	by	target	the	antiapoptotic	protein	<Protein_Name>	
we	identify	<Number>	mir-155-specific	target	gene	in	bl	cell	and	confirm	<RNA_Name>	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	jarid6	
qrt-pcr	analysis	of	the	liver	from	these	animal	after	one	week	of	treatment	show	a	significantly	increase	<RNA_Name>	level	of	<Number>	copy	per	1ng	total	rna	with	concomitant	decrease	in	the	protein	level	of	two	of	its	validated	target	namely	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
study	from	both	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	show	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	bind	with	3'utr	of	mrna	thus	promote	cell	growth	migration	while	inhibit	cell	apoptosis	
the	subsequent	luciferase	assay	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	gc	cell	lead	to	the	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	thus	promote	cell	proliferation	migration	while	reduce	cell	apoptosis	
these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	an	important	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	in	gc	cell	and	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
ectopic	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	reduce	the	expression	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	tscc	cell	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	at	least	in	part	by	regulate	the	stability	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
furthermore	as	show	in	figure	2c	ectopic	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	reduce	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	um1	cell	and	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	use	anti-mir-138	pna	increase	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	um2	cell	
as	illustrate	in	figure	<Number>	our	result	suggest	a	novel	paradigm	in	which	<RNA_Name>	regulates	rhoc-specific	<Protein_Name>	signal	cascade	by	target	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	concurrently	and	suppress	their	expression	at	posttranscriptional	level	
both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	synthetic	mimic	significantly	inhibit	the	expression	of	a	reporter	construct	contain	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	in	luciferase	assay	
thus	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	functionally	interact	with	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	suppress	the	corresponding	protein	product	
up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	promotes	apoptosis	of	hypoxic	ratneonatal	cardiomyocytes	by	repress	gsk-3-beta	protein	expression	
we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
to	test	whether	gsk-3-beta	be	a	<RNA_Name>	targetgene	in	cardiomyocytes	we	have	confirm	that	h2o2	decrease	gsk-3-beta	expression	in	cultured	cardiomyocytes	and	
<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	bindto	gsk-3-beta	and	regulate	its	expression	directly	use	a	construct	in	which	a	fragment	of	the	<Number>	its	exprgsk-3-beta	mrna	with	the	putative	<RNA_Name>	binding	sequence	
this	result	indicate	that	gsk-3-beta	be	indeed	a	functional	targetgene	of	<RNA_Name>	that	be	involve	in	mir-26a-mediated	pro-apoptotic	effect	on	cardiomyocyte	injury	elicit	by	h2o2	
for	this	reason	we	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	induced	apoptosis	in	h2o2-stimulated	cardiomyocytes	by	post-transcriptional	regulation	of	gsk-3-beta	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	in	np	cell	
these	data	support	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	and	specifically	regulate	<Protein_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	
we	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	specifically	target	by	<RNA_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	
here	we	demonstrate	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	two	transcription	factor	involve	in	regulate	mammary	cell	differentiation	pr	and	<Protein_Name>	
interestingly	we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	a	corepressor	partner	of	<Protein_Name>	
luciferase	reporter	assay	confirm	a	significant	down-regulation	of	hdac4-	3'utr	by	<RNA_Name>	mimic	compare	with	scrambled	control	in	multiple	cell	line	
this	interaction	be	abrogate	when	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	hdac4-3'utr	be	delete	or	mutate	which	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
altogether	these	result	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	rna	be	find	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	indirectly	by	modulate	<Protein_Name>	synthesis	
with	an	integrated	target	prediction	tool	<Protein_Name>	be	predict	to	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	miranda	<Protein_Name>	rnahybrid	and	targetscan	to	
validate	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	indeed	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	we	test	the	ability	of	<RNA_Name>	to	recognize	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	use	a	dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	
confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	indeed	direct	downstream	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	identify	an	additional	<Number>	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	mirna-interaction	site	present	in	at	least	two	library	<Number>	<Number>	of	which	could	be	assign	to	a	mirna	
the	level	of	<RNA_Name>	in	cov644	and	ovcar-3	cell	significantly	increase	after	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	as	compare	to	cell	transfected	with	a	scramble	mirna	
the	binding	site	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	show	
our	finding	strongly	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	through	directly	bind	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	significantly	suppress	the	activity	of	wt	but	not	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	human	asmcs	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	suppress	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	while	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	elevate	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	human	asmcs	
take	together	these	result	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	could	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	a	partially	complementary	bind	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
we	conclude	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	reduce	during	neural	differentiation	and	that	this	effect	be	at	least	in	part	mediate	by	<RNA_Name>	
it	be	plausible	that	chronic	morphine	exposure	may	increase	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	which	in	turn	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	contribute	to	the	behavioral	manifestation	of	opioid	tolerance	
finally	we	demonstrate	that	lmp1-mediated	activation	of	<RNA_Name>	in	an	ebv-negative	background	correlate	with	reduction	of	protein	pu	<Number>	which	be	a	possible	<Protein_Name>	targe	
in	addition	the	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	in	endometriosis	be	associate	with	a	reduction	on	<Protein_Name>	expression	
<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	enhance	both	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	level	in	mcf7	and	mcf10a	cell	
thus	variant	allele	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	affect	the	binding	ability	of	<RNA_Name>	to	<Protein_Name>	but	not	the	abundance	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	also	inhibit	plsg-lmp1nt671	but	not	plsg-lmp1nt692	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	5'region	of	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
when	we	test	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	cdk-2	expression	by	transfection	of	pre-mir-124a	into	primary	ra	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	cell	we	find	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	substantially	suppress	the	expression	of	cdk-2	in	both	cell	type	
as	show	in	figure	4d	<RNA_Name>	selectively	suppress	the	luciferase	activity	drive	by	the	wild-type	3'utr	but	not	the	mutant	form	of	cdk-2	mrna	indicate	that	cdk-2	mrna	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
further	analysis	of	<RNA_Name>	in	vivo	oncogenic	function	reveals	that	it	be	mediate	through	its	negative	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
as	show	in	<Protein_Name>	5a	and	b	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	level	be	significantly	reduce	in	<Protein_Name>	paca-2	cell	transfected	with	pre-	ir373	while	all	three	protein	be	increase	in	<Protein_Name>	paca-2	cell	transfected	with	anti-373	indicate	a	direct	post-	ranscriptional	regulation	of	those	three	target	gene	by	<RNA_Name>	in	addition	this	study	provide	a	comprehensive	mechanism	for	zip4-	ediated	pancreatic	cancer	growth	involve	creb-	ependent	transcription	enhancement	of	oncogenic	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	reduction	in	key	<RNA_Name>	regulate	target	include	the	tumour	suppressor	gene	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
finally	in	transfected	<Protein_Name>	and	293t	cell	overexpression	with	vector	express	<RNA_Name>	
the	cyclin-dependent	kinase	inhibitor	<Protein_Name>	and	the	tyrosine-kinase	receptor	c-kit	have	be	identify	as	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
moreover	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	directly	target	the	3'utr	sequence	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	agree	with	the	fact	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	by	target	the	3'utr	of	it	and	suppress	its	translation	
in	conclusion	our	result	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	and	overexpressed	<RNA_Name>	could	suppress	the	<Protein_Name>	level	and	block	the	hmgb1-mediated	autophagy	in	drug-treated	ec	cell	
<Protein_Name>	be	the	<RNA_Name>	targetgene	
to	determine	whether	<RNA_Name>	affect	the	expression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	we	perform	immunoblotting	analysis	and	find	that	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	considerably	decrease	in	the	ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	follow	ane	exposure	in	contrast	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	restored	expression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	follow	ane	exposure	
similar	result	be	also	see	where	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	be	repress	by	<RNA_Name>	
the	result	reveal	that	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	mimic	but	not	control	dsrna	markedly	inhibit	the	production	of	mkp-1	protein	
<RNA_Name>	represses	mkp-1	expression	through	interaction	with	the	3'utr	of	mkp-1	
transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	markedly	inhibit	the	luciferase	activity	for	the	wild-type	3'utr	of	mkp-1	but	show	no	repression	effect	for	the	mutated	3'utr	of	mkp-1	when	compare	with	that	for	the	control	dsrna	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	repress	mkp-1	expression	by	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	mkp-1	in	a	direct	and	sequence-specific	manner	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	regulate	the	lps-induced	activation	of	<Protein_Name>	or	<Protein_Name>	through	target	mkp-1	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	can	be	induce	by	different	tlr	ligand	and	may	play	a	role	in	the	innate	immune	response	to	microbial	infection	through	target	mkp-1	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	downstream	molecule	via	target	n-ras	and	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	transcriptional	activation	through	target	both	n-ras	and	<Protein_Name>	that	be	functional	
meanwhile	the	activation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	signal	pathway	and	the	expression	of	hif-1alpha	be	significantly	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	the	downstream	target	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	be	also	inhibit	by	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	when	compare	to	negative	control	demonstrate	that	in	an	animal	model	<RNA_Name>	can	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	activation	by	target	n-ras	and	<Protein_Name>	thus	suppress	the	downstream	molecules	hif-1	and	<Protein_Name>	which	be	involve	in	tumor	angiogenesis	and	tumor	growth	
therefore	it	appear	that	<RNA_Name>	do	not	affect	mmp-2	mrna	expression	
<RNA_Name>	target	matrix	metallopeptidase-2	and	repress	pro-mmp-2	protein	expression	
interestingly	among	the	already	experimentally	confirm	target	of	the	<RNA_Name>	family	be	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	that	have	two	bind	site	of	<RNA_Name>	
as	show	by	the	respective	luciferase	assay	in	supplementary	figure	s4d	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	by	<RNA_Name>	applies	also	to	neuronal	cell	
administration	of	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	target	protector	be	able	to	rescue	<RNA_Name>	mimic-mediated	learning	impairment	and	result	in	increased	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	thus	confirm	that	action	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	protein	in	vivo	be	direct	and	base	on	<RNA_Name>	mrna	interaction	
<RNA_Name>	induced	impairment	of	associative	learning	correspond	with	reduced	<Protein_Name>	level	confirm	successful	incorporation	of	<RNA_Name>	mimic	into	the	<Protein_Name>	complex	and	specific	translational	repression	of	target	mrna	
furthermore	specific	blocking	of	the	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	its	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	binding	site	through	mirna	target	protector	be	able	to	reverse	the	above	effect	
importantly	we	identify	that	the	3-	-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	report	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	can	inhibit	epithelial-mesenchymal	transition	and	identify	a	new	target	integrin	<Protein_Name>	
collectively	these	result	reveal	the	negative	regulatory	role	of	<RNA_Name>	to	<Protein_Name>	in	mg-63	cell	in	addition	we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	play	a	suppressor	role	in	osteosarcoma	tumorigenesis	
<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	downregulated	in	cell	engineer	to	express	<RNA_Name>	mirnas	and	also	show	that	<Protein_Name>	translation	be	inhibit	by	several	<RNA_Name>	mirnas	in	particular	by	<RNA_Name>	which	show	mirna	seed	complementarity	to	two	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	3'utr	
we	observe	a	significant	inhibition	of	luciferase	from	reporter	contain	the	3'utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	the	presence	of	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	in	contrast	neither	mirna	have	any	effect	on	the	<Protein_Name>	or	nfat2cip	3'utrs	
thus	these	assay	confirm	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	be	target	of	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
here	use	a	global	microarray-based	mirna	profile	approach	follow	by	validation	with	quantitative	reverse	transcription	polymerase	chain	reaction	we	have	demonstrate	that	conserve	<RNA_Name>	family	member	be	up-regulated	in	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	in	<Protein_Name>	hcc	cell	isolate	from	<Protein_Name>	tumor	
importantly	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	a	reduction	in	<Protein_Name>	hcc	cell	quantity	and	tumor	initiate	ability	whereas	exogenous	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	hcc	cell	result	in	an	enrichment	of	<Protein_Name>	hcc	cell	
take	together	our	result	define	a	novel	regulatory	link	between	mir-181s	and	human	<Protein_Name>	liver	cancer	stem	progenitor	cell	and	imply	that	molecular	targeting	of	<RNA_Name>	may	eradicate	hcc	
the	first	example	include	a	<Protein_Name>	complementary	to	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	its	expression	promote	the	retention	of	a	large	intron	at	the	5-	-end	of	the	sense	transcript	
it	have	be	report	that	<RNA_Name>	could	post-transcriptionally	downregulate	tumor	suppressor	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	stimulate	invasion	and	metastasis	in	colorectal	cancer	and	breast	cancer	cell	
so	we	check	whether	these	two	<RNA_Name>	target	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	prostate	cancer	cell	
s2	antimir-21	significantly	increase	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	a	dose-dependent	manner	
bioinformatics	analysis	show	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	to	inhibit	its	translation	which	be	prove	by	luciferase	reporter	assay	
to	determine	whether	gene	identify	in	pc12	cell	also	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	knockdown	in	vivo	we	use	il-6	as	a	test	case	because	of	its	involvement	in	nervous	system	function	
for	example	<RNA_Name>	and	-125a	up-regulation	as	well	as	<RNA_Name>	b	down-regulation	by	both	<Protein_Name>	form	be	verify	the	
figure	4a	illustrate	the	approximate	binding	site	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	within	the	-beta2-subunit	3'utr	region	
subsequent	luciferase	reporter	gene	assay	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	significantly	repressed	luciferase	activity	whereas	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	have	no	effect	
a	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	seed	site	within	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	show	
<RNA_Name>	over-expression	promotes	migration	and	survival	by	directly	repress	microphthalmia-associated	transcription	factor-m	and	<Protein_Name>	
further	evidence	that	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	actively	block	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	melanoma	cell	come	from	our	observation	that	transfection	of	anti-mir-182	oligonucleotides	result	in	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	up-regulation	
finally	concomitant	over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	either	<Protein_Name>	or	mitf-m	abolish	the	stimulatory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	the	invasive	capacity	of	melanoma	cell	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	repression	be	necessary	effector	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	interacts	with	two	of	its	targetsites	on	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	cause	mrna	degradation	and	decreased	expression	and	activity	of	<Protein_Name>	
moreover	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	function	in	451lu	cell	also	increase	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
these	data	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	with	short	3'utr	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
together	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	act	through	its	targetsites	on	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	lead	to	its	destabilization	
<Protein_Name>	be	directly	downregulated	by	<RNA_Name>	in	gastric	cell	line	
next	we	validate	<Protein_Name>	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	dual	luciferase	report	assay	
thus	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	binding	site	locate	at	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	<Protein_Name>	may	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
pylorus	and	its	key	virulent	factor	<Protein_Name>	induce	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	inhibit	that	of	<RNA_Name>	which	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	result	in	cell	proliferation	for	gastric	carcinogenesis	by	reduce	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	promoter	activity	and	its	expression	
<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	associate	with	oxidative	stress	or	activation	of	the	hypoxic	response	<Protein_Name>	which	be	sufficient	to	drive	authophagy	mitophagy	
overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	could	significantly	reverse	the	oncogenic	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	<RNA_Name>	might	promote	gc	cell	growth	and	motility	partially	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
this	technology	be	use	to	regenerate	critical-sized	bone	defect	in	osteoporotic	mouse	by	target	gsk-3b	to	activate	the	osteoblastic	activity	of	endogenous	stem	cell	thus	address	a	critical	challenge	in	regenerative	medicine	of	achieve	cell-free	scaffold-based	mirna	therapy	for	tissue	engineering	
take	together	these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	upregulates	ob	activity	through	functionally	target	gsk-3b	
mechanistically	we	find	that	osteogenic	action	of	<RNA_Name>	be	through	functionally	target	gsk-3b	to	increase	the	ob	activity	rather	than	to	suppress	osteoclast	activity	
here	we	show	that	two	mirnas	<RNA_Name>	and	mmu-mir-199a	be	spatiotemporally	express	in	the	mouse	uterus	during	implantation	coincident	with	expression	of	cyclooxygenase-2	a	gene	critical	for	implantation	
because	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	overlap	with	cox-2	in	the	pregnant	mouse	uterus	we	assume	that	cox-2	mrna	expression	be	posttranscriptionally	regulate	by	these	mirnas	
we	use	two	independent	gain-of-function	and	a	loss-of-function	strategy	to	show	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	repress	cox-2	translation	
these	result	show	that	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	interact	with	the	3'utr	of	mcox-2	mrna	in	vitro	lead	to	its	translational	repression	
this	result	provide	further	evidence	that	cox-2	mrna	be	posttranscriptionally	control	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
base	on	these	result	we	want	to	determine	what	effect	akba	treatment	in	these	crc	cell	line	have	on	direct	or	downstream	target	of	the	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	family	of	mirnas	
we	choose	to	measure	the	effect	of	akba	on	<Protein_Name>	e-cadherin	and	<Protein_Name>	all	downstream	target	of	the	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	family	of	mirnas	
level	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	be	significantly	reduce	in	all	cell	line	by	treatment	with	akba	whereas	level	of	e-cadherin	be	significantly	increase	in	hct116	and	ht29	cell	
take	together	we	interpret	these	result	to	indicate	that	akba	induce	up-regulation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	mirnas	as	manifest	by	subsequent	modulation	of	the	expression	of	their	target	gene	to	impact	crc	cell	growth	and	metastasis

thus	we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	may	affect	bmbc	cell	invasion	and	metastasis	through	hpse-regulated	protein	and	<Protein_Name>	signal	
because	<RNA_Name>	have	be	predict	to	target	smad-1	and	smad-4	we	next	assess	the	direct	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	the	expression	of	these	pro-differentiation	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	bmp	cascade	molecule	
a	luciferase	reporter	assay	detect	<RNA_Name>	binding	to	the	3-	untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	that	be	absent	after	target	mutagenesis	
in	cultured	hek293	cell	we	determine	the	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	gene

these	data	collectively	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	by	bind	to	its	3'utr	at	position	717-724	
these	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	show	inverse	correlation	of	expression	under	various	condition	test	thus	confirm	<Protein_Name>	as	bonafide	<RNA_Name>	target	thus	overall	base	on	above	result	we	confirm	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	target	transcript	of	<RNA_Name>	in	mcf7	cell	with	maximal	effect	be	observe	for	<Protein_Name>	
thus	mir-191-induced	cell	proliferation	and	migration	seem	to	be	partially	dependent	on	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	
these	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	show	inverse	correlation	of	expression	under	various	condition	test	thus	confirm	<Protein_Name>	as	bonafide	<RNA_Name>	target

furthermore	we	note	a	significant	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	that	target	<Protein_Name>	and	lead	to	its	decreased	expression	in	thymus	in	the	progeny	of	exposed	parent	
therefore	we	propose	that	mir-468-mediated	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	lead	to	aberrant	methylation	of	line1	and	sine	b2	in	the	thymus	tissue	of	the	progeny	of	exposed	parent	
experiment	indicate	that	at	the	same	time	oct-4	expression	increase	while	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	become	barely	detectable	
so	this	suggest	that	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	oct-4	reflect	the	two	opposite	developmental	path	of	embryonic	cell	
upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	whereas	<RNA_Name>	be	downregulated	in	in	acute	promyelocytic	leukemia	patient	and	cell	line	during	all-trans-retinoic	acid	treatment	
moreover	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	downregulated	in	the	f5m2	cell	treat	with	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	compare	to	cell	treat	with	the	nc	mimic	or	the	untreated	cell	
<Protein_Name>	cell	treat	with	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	also	exhibit	a	low	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	than	cell	treat	with	the	nc	mimic	
these	result	together	reveal	a	negative	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	osteosarcoma	and	knockdown	of	<Protein_Name>	by	sirna	inhibits	the	migration	and	invasion	of	osteosarcoma	cell	
on	investigate	the	mechanism	involve	in	il-23	mediated	migration	and	invasion	we	observe	that	<RNA_Name>	promote	the	migration	and	invasion	of	thyroid	cancer	cell	by	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	that	lead	to	the	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	
together	these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	mir-	<Number>	in	k1	cell	and	wro	cell	
these	result	suggest	that	the	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	responsible	for	the	ability	of	mir-	<Number>	to	promote	cell	invasion	and	migration	
take	together	these	data	suggest	that	mir-	<Number>	be	the	key	component	involve	in	il-23-mediated	thyroid	cancer	cell	migration	and	invasion	through	the	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	finding	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	indirectly	up-regulated	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	its	binding	to	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	analysis	also	show	that	dna	methylation	at	<Protein_Name>	be	reduce	by	<RNA_Name>	precursor	in	the	lps-treated	cell	
however	dna	methylation	at	<Protein_Name>	be	increase	by	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	
therefore	we	demonstrate	a	consistent	change	between	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	methylation	by	the	change	of	<RNA_Name>	level	
functional	analysis	demonstrate	that	this	region	of	<RNA_Name>	can	influence	the	alternative	splicing	of	<Protein_Name>	pre-mrna	support	a	role	for	some	snornas	in	the	regulation	of	splice	
as	the	expression	of	the	gene	<Protein_Name>	be	generally	low	in	most	cell	type	make	experimental	investigation	difficult	we	therefore	concentrate	on	test	the	possibility	of	a	functional	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	snorna	and	<Protein_Name>	pre-mrna	
in	summary	we	conclude	that	the	presence	of	<RNA_Name>	snorna	can	affect	the	alternative	splicing	of	<Protein_Name>	pre-mrna	by	decrease	the	accumulation	of	the	8-10	isoform	
the	identification	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	as	a	notable	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	open	the	door	to	the	possibility	of	therapeutic	application	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	cancer-like	disease	such	as	lymphangiomyelomatosis	
take	together	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	could	induce	mesenchymal	phase	nmumg	to	fully	differentiate	into	smooth	muscle	cell	by	target	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	
we	use	a	luciferase	assay	to	validate	most	of	the	putative	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	target	
we	far	validate	<Protein_Name>	gene	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	by	use	western	blot	approach	
however	in	mesenchymal	phase	nmumg	cell	<Protein_Name>	down-regulation	affect	cell	proliferation	and	cell	cycle	concomitantly	with	the	observed	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	addition	the	identification	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	as	a	notable	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	open	the	door	to	the	possibility	of	therapeutic	application	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	cancer-like	disease	such	as	lymphangiomyelomatosis

thus	our	subsequent	effort	focus	on	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	two	micrornas	predict	to	targetppargamma	mrna	
among	the	mrna	show	increased	expression	during	human	adipogenesis	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	predict	to	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
in	a	well-established	model	of	murineadipogenesis	there	be	a	similar	decline	in	the	conserved	murinemir-130a	and	<RNA_Name>	and	a	concomitant	increase	in	mrnas	encode	adipocyte-specific	protein	
as	show	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	3t3-l1	cell	significantly	lower	the	abundance	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	differentiation	marker	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	reduce	<RNA_Name>	function	significantly	upregulated	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	
after	joint	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	be	also	potently	reduce	
take	together	these	finding	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	interacts	with	the	<Protein_Name>	cr	and	3'utr	thereby	repress	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	level	
the	3'-utrs	of	cfl2and	<Protein_Name>	each	contain	one	functional	<RNA_Name>	target	sequence	while	<Protein_Name>	contains	two	evolutionarily	conserve	<RNA_Name>	target	sit	that	function	cooperatively	to	suppress	<Protein_Name>	expression	
take	together	these	data	suggest	that	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	the	secretory	pathway	be	inhibit	by	<RNA_Name>	
the	tumor-suppressive	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	be	determine	by	in	vitro	assay	through	gain-of-function	study	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	can	inhibit	lscc	cell	proliferation	motility	and	invasion	and	promote	their	apoptosis	
ectopic	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	a	significant	reduction	in	<Protein_Name>	and	its	downstream	signal	molecule	<Protein_Name>	at	both	the	mrna	and	protein	level	in	lscc	cell	
our	result	suggest	that	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	be	one	of	the	molecular	mechanism	for	the	development	and	progression	of	lscc	by	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	affect	its	downstream	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	
furthermore	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	may	serve	as	a	novel	therapeutic	target	for	lscc	
in	the	present	study	the	human	<Protein_Name>	one	binding	protein	be	identify	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	a	potential	oncogene	in	human	glioma

our	study	firstly	find	that	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	more	conservation	than	that	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	post-transcriptionally	repress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
moreover	our	finding	also	demonstrate	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	may	promote	cell	proliferation	via	post-transcriptionally	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	293t

these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	<RNA_Name>	targetin	the	retina	and	that	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	by	<RNA_Name>	be	necessary	for	retinal	cell	survival	
these	result	suggest	that	a	proper	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	which	be	affect	by	<RNA_Name>	be	require	for	the	appropriate	development	of	axon	in	the	dentate	gyrus	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	primary	targetgene	of	<RNA_Name>	and	be	responsible	for	the	<RNA_Name>	phenotypes	include	both	the	reduction	of	retinal	cone	cell	number	and	mossy	<Protein_Name>	elongation	of	the	dentate	gyrus

these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	thus	regulate	its	expression	
a	dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	be	perform	to	confirm	the	direct	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	on	the	target	gene	<Protein_Name>	
morphine	may	protect	cardiomyocytes	against	h	r	injury	through	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
collectively	these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	may	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	far	identify	<RNA_Name>	and	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	as	the	critical	mirna	and	target	gene	which	might	contribute	to	the	cardioprotection	of	<Protein_Name>	
a	luciferaseactivity	significantly	decrease	in	the	transfectants	suggest	that	actual	binding	occur	between	<RNA_Name>	and	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
we	use	a	vector	encode	full-length	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	find	that	the	luminescence	intensity	be	significantly	reduce	in	the	<RNA_Name>	transfectants	compare	to	the	counterpart	
the	xtt	assay	demonstrate	that	obvious	increase	of	cell	proliferation	be	not	find	in	srsf9-transfected	cell	compare	with	the	control	and	that	cell	proliferation	of	mir-1-transfected	cell	be	significantly	reduce	even	in	the	cell	with	co-transfection	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	vector	
n	summary	we	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	may	function	as	tumor	suppressor	through	repression	of	oncogenic	<Protein_Name>	in	bc	and	restoration	of	<RNA_Name>	and	srsf9-knockdown	increase	caspase-3	<Number>	activity	result	in	apoptosis

use	a	luciferase	reporting	system	and	sequence	analysis	the	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	be	identify	as	sprouty	homolog	<Number>	which	inhibits	protein	kinase	calpha-mediated	activation	of	mitogen-activated	protein	kinases	especially	<Protein_Name>	phosphorylation	in	addition	we	confirm	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	as	the	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	mir-411-5p-m	in	the	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	at	the	protein	level	in	the	sjcrh30	<Protein_Name>	cell	line	
we	explore	the	biological	function	of	<RNA_Name>	by	examine	six	potential	target	base	on	the	prediction	of	three	different	bioinformatic	algorithm	and	identified	<Protein_Name>	as	the	most	likely	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
bv	mirna	<Number>	be	antisense	relative	to	a	sequence	<Protein_Name>	nt	upstream	of	the	initiate	aug	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	which	encode	the	catalytic	subunit	of	the	dna	polymerase	
therefore	mirna	<Number>	may	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	the	same	way	that	the	ebv-encoded	mirna	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	expression	of	the	ebv	dna	polymerase	
furthermore	we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	the	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
thus	we	suppose	that	<Protein_Name>	as	a	major	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	regulating	cell	proliferation	and	metastasis	
meanwhile	we	prove	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	at	a	posttranscriptional	level	and	as	a	major	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	regulating	cell	proliferation	and	metastasis	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	can	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	its	3'utr	
computationalprediction	and	microarray	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	disabled	homolog-2	and	luciferase	reporter	assay	confirm	that	the	target	site	of	<RNA_Name>	be	locate	at	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene

<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	targetfor	<RNA_Name>	
importantly	mutation	of	six	base	in	the	candidate	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	totally	abrogated	mir-223-dependent	repression	
the	observed	small	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	compare	to	<Protein_Name>	protein	might	be	the	result	of	mirna-	mediate	mrna-decay	couple	to	translational	repression	
these	experiment	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	interact	with	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
as	show	in	figure	5a	the	enforced	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	degradation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	in	a	decrease	of	about	<Number>	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
we	also	discover	that	luciferase	activity	be	exclusively	decrease	by	target	<Protein_Name>	in	hmscs	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic

these	observation	implicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	potential	mediator	in	tumor-induced	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	in	ec	
indeed	high	<Protein_Name>	expression	correlate	with	low	<RNA_Name>	expression	indicate	the	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	by	<Protein_Name>	in	breast	cancer	patient	
previous	study	have	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	gene	of	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
to	confirm	whether	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	target	to	<Protein_Name>	in	tscc	cell	we	conduct	luciferase	reporter	assay	by	evaluate	the	relative	luciferase	activity	in	the	cell	transfected	with	a	reporter	plasmid	carry	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	target	sequence	versus	those	transfected	with	a	control	plasmid	
however	when	the	mirna	target	sequence	be	mutate	in	the	reporter	plasmid	transfection	with	mimic	of	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	do	not	influence	the	relative	luciferase	activity	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	suppress	<Protein_Name>	translation	in	tscc	cell	
figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	regulate	emt	in	cal27-res	cell	by	target	to	<Protein_Name>	
collectively	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	regulate	chemotherapy-induced	emt	of	tscc	cell	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	the	metastasis	of	tscc	in	vivo	probably	via	silence	<Protein_Name>	
our	data	show	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	level	be	significantly	increase	in	ir	adipocytes	compare	with	normal	adipocytes	over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	decrease	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	whereas	it	have	no	significant	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	in	ir-adipocytes	
these	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	in	3t3-l1	adipocytes	
take	together	these	result	suggest	the	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	activation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	pathway	without	perturb	<Protein_Name>	upstream	signaling	molecule

<Protein_Name>	protein	level	be	extremely	up-regulated	by	<RNA_Name>	silencing	compare	with	control	
take	together	the	action	of	<RNA_Name>	to	suppress	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	level	in	bmms	be	a	prerequisite	for	induction	of	osteoclastic	transcription	factor	specific	marker	and	osteoclastogenesis	in	addition	elevate	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	level	by	decreased	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	remarkably	attenuate	by	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	indicate	that	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	for	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	be	physiologically	pivotal	in	osteoclastogenesis	
thus	osteopetrosis	in	<Protein_Name>	cko	mouse	may	be	cause	by	impaired	<RNA_Name>	level	and	up-regulated	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	bmms	
in	addition	both	targetscan	<Number>	<Number>	and	pictar	give	high	confidence	prediction	that	<Protein_Name>	would	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
this	prediction	be	support	by	an	evolutionarily	deep	conservation	of	two	<RNA_Name>	bind	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
thus	at	least	in	these	two	cancer	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	such	that	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	be	achieve	in	part	through	modulation	of	<RNA_Name>	expression

the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	be	then	assess	by	cell	viability	cell	cycle	analysis	apoptosis	assay	and	cisplatin	resistance	assay	in	both	cell	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	induce	cell	survival	and	cisplatin	resistance	and	reduce	cell	apoptosis	
moreover	luciferase	reporter	assay	and	western	blot	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	prove	that	by	modulate	cyclin	g1	<RNA_Name>	influence	<Protein_Name>	protein	stability	and	transcriptional	activity	and	reduces	invasion	capability	of	hcc-derived	cell	line	
in	addition	in	a	therapeutic	perspective	we	assay	the	effect	of	a	restored	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	trigger	doxorubicin-induced	apoptosis	and	we	prove	that	<RNA_Name>	as	well	as	cyclin	g1	silence	increase	sensitivity	to	doxorubicin	challenge	
in	patient	resect	for	hcc	lower	<RNA_Name>	level	be	associate	with	a	short	<Protein_Name>	whereas	high	cyclin	g1	expression	be	relate	to	a	low	survival	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	might	represent	an	effective	molecular	target	for	hcc	
this	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	may	suppress	theexpression	of	c	ebp-beta	and	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	target	their	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	
we	also	perform	a	luciferase	reporter	assay	to	test	whether	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	the	3'utrs	of	c	ebp-beta	and	<Protein_Name>

take	together	these	data	be	consistent	with	our	hypothesis	and	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	interact	with	<RNA_Name>	to	link	<RNA_Name>	and	the	post-transcriptional	network	in	gastric	pathogenesis	
as	<Protein_Name>	be	a	master	regulator	of	osteoblast	differentiation	we	deduce	that	<RNA_Name>	might	play	a	role	in	osteoblast	differentiation	to	validate	the	prediction	a	series	of	3'utr	fragment	comprise	that	from	the	wt	d1	d2	and	d3	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	to	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	directly	and	that	both	site	<Number>	and	site	<Number>	be	the	bind	site	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	further	find	that	<Protein_Name>	stimulate	expression	of	the	growth	differentiation	factor	<Number>	by	enhance	<Protein_Name>	bind	to	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	promoter	
these	data	indicate	that	specific	rna	folding	be	critical	to	<Protein_Name>	activation	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	transfection	of	<Protein_Name>	dna	do	not	cause	<Protein_Name>	activation	
instead	transcription	of	<Protein_Name>	be	require	for	<Protein_Name>	activation	
take	together	these	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	crc	
furthermore	we	identify	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	decreased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	have	the	similar	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	restoration	on	proliferation	migration	and	invasion	of	crc	cell

<Protein_Name>	have	be	report	to	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	study	of	insulin	secretion	
moreover	with	the	online	prediction	tool	pictar	and	targetscan	we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	to	two	different	site	in	the	3'utr	of	sirt	the	result	show	that	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	wt	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	cell	that	be	treat	with	a	<RNA_Name>	mimic	be	significantly	decrease	
we	find	that	the	mrna	and	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	increase	in	hscs	upon	application	of	a	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	
follow	transfection	with	a	<RNA_Name>	mimic	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	decrease

furthermore	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	suppress	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	level	in	addition	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	induced	nf-kappab	phosphorylation	and	subsequently	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	downstream	effector	of	<RNA_Name>	involve	in	the	regulation	of	the	nf-kappab	inflammatory	response	
<RNA_Name>	inhibit	the	translation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
our	chip	experiment	also	show	that	over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	do	not	obviously	decrease	the	abundance	of	<Protein_Name>	on	the	<Protein_Name>	promoter	
these	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
therefore	it	be	possible	that	the	overexpressed	<Protein_Name>	first	up-regulated	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	then	down-regulated	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	by	up-regulating	<RNA_Name>	transcription	lead	to	the	above	phenomenon	in	reporter	assay	
<Protein_Name>	overexpression	indeed	upregulated	<RNA_Name>	a	member	of	the	<RNA_Name>	cluster	
to	far	validate	the	co-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	cell	cycle	progression	we	first	monitor	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	in	synchronized	<Protein_Name>	cell	and	find	that	<Protein_Name>	transcription	be	up-regulated	during	s	phase

data	show	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	emt	of	hk-2	cell	induce	by	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	
the	result	show	that	in	both	mrna	and	protein	level	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	on	the	other	hand	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	raise	<Protein_Name>	level	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	modulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	its	3'utr	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	-16	-195	and	-424	suppress	the	activity	of	a	luciferase	reporter	construct	<Protein_Name>	with	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	
therefore	it	be	hypothesize	that	<RNA_Name>	-16	-195	and	-424	could	down-regulate	<Protein_Name>	which	decrease	cellular	<Protein_Name>	level	via	<Protein_Name>

these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	-16	-195	and	-424	have	similar	effect	in	the	recognition	and	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
the	present	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	-16	-195	and	-424	can	modulate	cellular	<Protein_Name>	level	in	the	heart	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
we	further	focus	on	<Protein_Name>	because	of	its	strong	regulation	after	<RNA_Name>	transfection	on	the	mrna	level	detect	by	qrt-pcr	its	potential	direct	regulation	via	the	3'utr	binding	site	and	its	possible	role	in	ra	and	hyaluronic	acid	degradation	
we	analyze	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	early	passage	rasf	after	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	control	or	<Protein_Name>	and	find	a	strong	regulation	of	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	on	protein	level	in	rasf	from	two	different	donor	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	ra

these	result	provide	further	evidence	that	cox-2	mrna	be	post-transcriptionally	control	by	<RNA_Name>	
the	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	specifically	bind	to	the	3'utr	region	of	cox-2	and	repress	cox-2	translation	reinforce	the	hypothesis	that	cox-2	mrna	be	a	direct	target	for	<RNA_Name>	
the	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	interacts	with	cox-2	mrna	and	promote	cox-2	protein	decrease	mostly	through	a	translational	repression	mechanism	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	exert	its	pro-apoptotic	function	partially	through	decrease	cox-2	expression	
these	result	agree	with	the	in	vitro	data	and	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	the	proliferation	of	hepatoma	cell	among	other	mechanism	through	downregulation	of	cox-2

this	study	discover	coregulatory	interaction	between	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	their	regulation	of	the	gene	kr	ppel-like	factor	<Number>	
consistent	with	the	luciferase-klf9-3'utr	activity	that	demonstrate	a	strong	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	be	a	determine	factor	in	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	that	be	represent	in	the	coregulatory	network	of	<Protein_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>

however	the	expression	and	biological	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	osteosarcoma	carcinogenesis	and	progression	remain	unclear	in	this	study	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	significantly	decrease	in	human	o	cell	line	and	specimen	
restoration	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	could	inhibit	os	cell	proliferation	induce	cell	apoptosis	and	suppress	tumor	growth	in	nude	mouse	model

overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	block	the	inhibitory	function	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	our	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	act	as	a	novel	tumor	suppressor	to	regulate	o	cell	proliferation	and	apoptosis	through	downregulating	<Protein_Name>	expression	
to	verify	whether	b7-h1	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	a	dual-luciferase	reporter	system	be	employ	
these	result	suggest	that	this	site	in	the	3'utr	of	b7-h1	be	exact	regulation	site	for	<RNA_Name>

these	result	indicate	that	this	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	the	specific	regulation	site	for	<RNA_Name>	
the	finding	of	the	present	study	support	the	hypothesis	that	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	human	osteosarcoma	
in	the	same	experiment	we	purify	total	rna	from	aliquot	of	suspended	cell	and	monitor	the	abundance	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	<Protein_Name>	ncrna	by	real-time	pcr	
<Protein_Name>	suppress	both	binding	of	gr	to	<Protein_Name>	gres	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	in	a	dose-dependent	fashion	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	inhibit	association	of	gr	with	the	<Protein_Name>	gres	and	repress	gr-induced	transcriptional	activity	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	
luciferase	experiment	also	corroborate	vegf-a	as	a	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
however	this	inhibition	be	not	observe	when	co-transfection	be	perform	with	the	vector	contain	the	specific	mutate	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	could	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
furthermore	luciferase	experiment	indicate	that	vegf-a	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	also	in	human

also	we	find	gammah2ax	expression	be	downregulated	with	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	and	restore	after	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	
our	result	suggest	that	low	level	of	<RNA_Name>	in	sclc	cell	and	associate	high	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	essential	for	dna	damage	repair	
on	the	basis	of	significant	increase	of	mrna	abundance	after	anti-mir	treatment	our	data	indicate	that	the	abundance	of	mrna	encode	by	the	following	hypertension	gwas	gene	be	suppress	by	endogenous	mirnas	in	endothelial	cell	predict	to	target	them	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	plasma	membrane	calcium-transporting	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	by	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	fibroblast	growth	factor	<Number>	by	numerous	member	of	the	<RNA_Name>	family	of	mirnas	include	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	golgi	<Protein_Name>	receptor	complex	member	<Number>	by	<RNA_Name>	jag	<Number>	by	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	adapter	protein	<Number>	by	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	mir-181a-5pm	and	t-box	<Number>	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>

we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	oxidase	<Number>	mrna	be	suppress	by	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	whereas	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	<Protein_Name>	oxidase	<Number>	mrna	be	not	significantly	suppress	by	the	mirnas	study	
tgf-b2	a	<RNA_Name>	target	gene	expression	be	decrease	in	hypoplastic	<Protein_Name>	lung	
collectively	these	data	suggest	that	basal	tgf-b-induced	signaling	be	temper	by	steady	state	level	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	reduce	<RNA_Name>	be	permissive	for	tgf-b-induced	signaling	
in	the	present	study	<Protein_Name>	be	identify	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
collectively	these	result	strongly	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	
furthermore	we	analyze	the	binding	energy	and	site	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	use	rnahybrid	software	and	the	result	imply	that	the	<RNA_Name>	mature	chain	be	partly	complementary	and	thus	potentially	bind	to	<RNA_Name>	
this	observation	allow	us	to	speculate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	directly	bind	to	<RNA_Name>	and	we	construct	luciferase	reporter	plasmid	contain	either	wild-type	<RNA_Name>	or	a	mutant	<RNA_Name>	
then	umuc2	cell	be	transfected	with	the	<RNA_Name>	or	control	mimic	plus	wildtype	<RNA_Name>	or	a	mutant	<RNA_Name>	
the	result	show	a	dose-dependent	repression	of	<RNA_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	
while	mutate	the	<RNA_Name>	site	in	<RNA_Name>	it	no	longer	elicit	such	a	significant	effect	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	contain	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	
transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	duplex	to	h1299	reduce	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	
down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	by	<RNA_Name>	be	also	evident	in	tera-2	and	retinoblastoma	cell	line	y79	and	weri-rb-1	
transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	decrease	the	expression	of	only	full-length	<Protein_Name>	mrna	but	not	the	truncated	<Protein_Name>	mrna	without	the	3'utr	et-7	
bioinformatics	integration	of	mirna	expression	and	proteomic	data	highlight	two	potential	mirna	protein	targetpairs	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	the	functional	interaction	between	these	mirnas	and	their	targetsequences	on	the	corresponding	mrna	be	confirm	by	luciferase	assay	
the	cancer	cell	apoptotic	death	be	due	to	a	marked	viral-induced	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	that	in	turn	upregulated	caspase-3	activity	
as	<Protein_Name>	have	be	show	to	induce	tgf-beta	during	<Protein_Name>	infection	and	tgf-beta	have	be	show	to	suppress	<RNA_Name>	expression	the	effect	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	silence	on	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	examine	
<RNA_Name>	expression	be	considerably	upregulated	support	the	hypothesis	that	ns1-induced	tgf-beta	suppresses	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	remove	<Protein_Name>	the	positive	inducer	of	tgf-beta	relief	tgf-beta-mediated	<RNA_Name>	suppression	
we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	multiple	gene	associate	with	glioma	cell	apoptosis	migration	and	invasiveness	include	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	suppressor	of	malignancy	and	inhibitor	of	matrix	metalloproteinases	
our	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	contributes	to	the	glioma	malignancy	by	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	inhibitor	that	lead	to	activation	of	mmps	thus	promote	invasiveness	of	cancer	cell	
use	human	corneal	epithelial	keratinocytes	we	demonstrate	that	fih-1	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
lower	<RNA_Name>	level	in	hceks	with	anatgo-31	which	increase	fih-1	and	deplete	corneal	epithelial	glycogen	store	be	the	reciprocal	situation	to	hydroxylase	inhibition	by	dmog	
a	target	site	for	<RNA_Name>	be	identify	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	5a	and	dual	luciferase	reporter	assay	be	perform	to	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	this	sequence	
<RNA_Name>	directly	target	and	reduce	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	tscc	
use	an	in	vitro	luciferase	reporter	assay	we	confirm	a	direct	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
mutant	reporter	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	not	repress	by	pre-mir-218	which	confirm	that	the	target	site	directly	mediate	the	repression	
take	together	our	result	show	that	<Number>	of	our	<Number>	predict	mirna-mrna	interaction	be	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
the	result	from	apo-one	homogeneous	caspase-3	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	be	consistent	with	the	above	two	apoptotic	assay	which	show	that	with	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	the	activity	of	caspase-3	<Number>	be	significantly	enhance	
because	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	mediates	axonal	regeneration	and	the	<RNA_Name>	cluster	target	<Protein_Name>	we	explore	the	possibility	that	elevation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	cluster	in	the	distal	axon	locally	modulate	<Protein_Name>	protein	
verexpression	of	the	<RNA_Name>	cluster	also	alter	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	pgsk-3-beta	in	the	cell	body	fraction	
this	finding	suggest	that	cyclin	d1	expression	and	g1	phase	transition	of	hepatocytes	the	conservation	of	<Protein_Name>	target	by	<RNA_Name>	be	far	support	by	a	recent	study	show	that	<RNA_Name>	promote	the	define	feature	of	the	metastatic	phenotype	migration	elongation	and	invasion	by	inhibit	the	human	gene	in	a	breast	cancer	cell	line	
view	together	our	finding	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	suppress	by	the	surge	in	<RNA_Name>	expression	occur	in	the	early	phase	of	liver	regeneration	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	knockdown	impair	g1	phase	exit	and	s	phase	entry	and	that	additional	<Protein_Name>	knockdown	restore	normal	cell	cycle	progression	which	confirm	<Protein_Name>	as	the	critical	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	promotion	of	g1	phase	progression	
view	together	our	result	exclude	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	as	the	reason	for	<Protein_Name>	and	mtorc1	activation	in	liver	regeneration	and	confirm	our	hypothesis	that	<RNA_Name>	facilitates	rapid	translation	of	cyclin	d1	by	relieve	<Protein_Name>	and	its	mediator	mtorc1	from	inhibition	by	<Protein_Name>	
over-expressed	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	promote	cell	growth	and	cell	cycle	progression	and	inhibit	apoptosis	through	negatively-regulating	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	after-transcriptionally	
by	use	immunoblotting	and	mirna-targetluciferase	activity	assay	as	show	in	figure	3e	and	supplementary	figure	s2b	and	c	we	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	in	bc	cell	
intriguingly	we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	which	be	one	of	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	be	inversely	correlate	with	the	expression	level	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	in	bc	tissue	
more	importantly	we	demonstrate	that	igf-ir	and	<Protein_Name>	often	overexpressed	in	bc	be	two	novel	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	
our	result	suggest	a	novel	<RNA_Name>	152-dnmt1	regulatory	circuit	and	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	act	as	tumor	suppressor	by	target	igf-ir	and	<Protein_Name>	and	that	restoration	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	expression	may	provide	a	strategy	for	therapeutic	application	to	treat	bc	patient	
meanwhile	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	inhibit	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	
the	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	form	a	negative	feedback	loop	that	be	disrupt	in	bc	cell	
thus	cellular	context	contributes	to	mirna-mediated	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
as	show	in	figure	6a	<RNA_Name>	down-regulated	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	expression	and	such	regulation	be	through	direct	binding	to	a	conserve	consensus	region	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	base	on	the	3'utr	luciferase	reporter	assay	in	summary	mechanistic	exploration	guide	by	integrative	analysis	of	tf	bind	site	enrichment	in	context	of	this	<Protein_Name>	infer	network	establish	a	novel	mechanism	of	action	by	<RNA_Name>	whereby	it	exert	its	diverse	transcriptomic	influence	through	the	modulation	of	the	tgf	transcriptomic	network	through	the	direct	binding	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
<Protein_Name>	be	predict	to	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	miranda	since	the	3-utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	contain	a	complementary	site	for	the	seed	region	of	<RNA_Name>	
indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	suppress	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	sequence	in	its	3'utr	
these	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	may	regulate	the	expression	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	its	mrna	and	thus	that	human	<Protein_Name>	may	be	a	new	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	igf-1r	and	inhibit	it	expression	
in	the	current	study	we	screen	and	identified	<Protein_Name>	be	a	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	npc	cell	
by	search	targetscan	we	choose	four	candidate	mirnas	which	be	predict	to	target	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	identify	that	<RNA_Name>	can	indeed	suppress	<Protein_Name>	in	npc	cell	
these	result	provide	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	recognize	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	transcription	and	translation	
17-beta-estradiol	regulates	cell	proliferation	colony	formation	migration	invasion	and	promotes	apoptosis	by	upregulating	<RNA_Name>	and	thus	degrades	<RNA_Name>	in	osteosarcoma	cell	mg-63	in	an	estrogen	receptor-independent	manner	
the	western	blotting	result	show	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	cardiomyocytes	significantly	down-regulated	<Protein_Name>	expression	level	while	atrovastatin	could	inhibit	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	markedly	increase	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
take	together	our	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	novel	mirna	that	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	may	be	a	novel	downstream	targetgene	of	<Protein_Name>	in	gastric	cancer	cell	
we	also	perform	quantitative	real-time	rt-pcr	analysis	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	and	find	that	exogenous	<RNA_Name>	modestly	but	significantly	suppress	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	in	hsc43	cell	
interestingly	exogenous	<RNA_Name>	transfection	dose-dependently	decrease	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	the	mouse	e	cell	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	represses	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	various	specie	and	cell	lineage	
moreover	the	double	deletion	mutant	vector	del-ab	show	complete	reversal	of	the	inhibitory	effect	of	the	pre-mir-126	co-transfection	indicating	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	the	two	bindsg	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	independently	
these	data	indicate	that	the	<RNA_Name>	expression	level	be	mostly	opposite	to	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	level	in	gastric	cancer	cell	line	
these	result	strongly	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	be	directly	and	translationally	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	
in	conclusion	<RNA_Name>	be	a	novel	mirna	with	tumor	suppressive	function	in	colon	cancer	by	target	oncogenic	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	promote	colon	cancer	growth	through	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	and	promote	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	and	serf	as	an	independent	prognostic	biomarker	for	crc	patient	
figure	<Number>	dbl-1	sma-6	daf-4	daf-1	and	daf-7	mrna	level	be	upregulated	in	the	<RNA_Name>	family	mutant	
apparently	the	3'-utrs	of	daf-1	and	daf-4	be	the	most	efficiently	mediator	of	genetic	repression	by	the	<RNA_Name>	family	as	their	mean	be	the	low	for	any	tested	mirna	
the	3'utr	of	sma-6	could	also	inhibit	luciferase	expression	with	any	of	the	<RNA_Name>	family	member	test	in	contrast	dbl-1	3'utr	activity	seem	more	restricted	
finally	the	3'utr	of	daf-7	seem	unable	to	inhibit	luciferase	gene	expression	through	any	of	the	mirnas	with	the	possible	exception	of	<RNA_Name>	because	of	a	small	but	statistically	significant	difference	with	respect	to	control	<RNA_Name>	
base	on	the	result	of	a	luciferase-reporter	assay	and	quantitative	rt-pcr	and	western	blotting	analysis	we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	gene	of	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	in	granulosa	cell	
thus	these	data	strongly	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	conclusion	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	positively	regulate	the	fasl-fas	pathway	by	target	<Protein_Name>	in	granulosa	cell	
previous	study	have	suggest	that	microrna-182	function	as	an	oncogene	and	play	a	role	in	tumorigenesis	through	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
additionally	we	demonstrate	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	transcriptionally	down-regulated	by	<RNA_Name>	
furthermore	we	demonstrate	that	the	tumor	suppressor	gene	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
collectively	these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	malignant	melanoma	cell

our	finding	highlight	the	importance	of	<RNA_Name>	in	regulate	the	metastatic	property	of	hcc	by	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	may	provide	new	insight	into	the	pathogenesis	of	hcc	in	contrast	the	reporter	vector	carry	the	mutate	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	could	restore	egfp	activity	when	this	construct	be	cotransfected	with	<RNA_Name>	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	might	suppress	gene	expression	through	the	mir-10a-bindsg	sequence	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	our	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	exert	its	function	by	way	of	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
our	research	thus	provide	new	insight	into	the	mechanism	of	the	pathogenesis	of	hcc	and	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	play	an	important	role	in	cancerogenesis	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	a	3'-untranslated	region	-dependent	fashion

these	result	collectively	suggest	a	direct	and	specific	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	on	bmi-1	3'utr	in	ec	cell	
these	result	indicate	that	reexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	could	reverse	the	emt	phenotype	and	dramatically	decrease	cell	invasion	in	bmi-1	express	ec	cell

the	result	of	<RNA_Name>	rt-qpcr	reveal	that	the	expression	level	of	<RNA_Name>	be	significantly	low	in	the	downregulation	group	than	in	the	negative	control	and	blank	control	group	while	there	be	no	statistically	significant	difference	between	the	latter	<Number>	group

as	show	in	figure	5e	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	reduced	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	corroborate	the	biological	effect	of	these	two	mirs	in	regulate	<Protein_Name>	in	npc	
mutate	the	seed	region	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	binding	in	the	pmir-report-ezh2	utr	vector	completely	abrogate	its	regulatory	activity	thereby	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	interact	with	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	can	specifically	down-regulate	the	expression	of	bcl-2	and	bcl-xl	and	increase	<Protein_Name>	activity	in	bel-7402	5-fu	cell	which	increase	cell	spontaneous	apoptosis	and	sensitize	cell	to	5-fu	
by	reporter	luciferase	assay	rt-pcr	and	western	blot	analysis	we	also	show	that	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	these	result	confirm	the	early	observation	that	<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
thus	the	increased	expression	level	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	in	sthdhq111	hdhq111	cell	could	be	due	to	decreased	expression	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	
moreover	over	expression	of	pre-mir-150	decrease	the	endogenous	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	sthdhq111	hdhq111	cell	as	show	by	western	blot	analysis	
these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	could	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	as	well	
thus	decreased	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	sthdhq111	hdhq111	cell	could	result	in	increased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
our	investigation	use	hd	cell	line	provide	important	observation	that	<RNA_Name>	be	regulate	by	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	increase	<Protein_Name>	could	be	mediate	through	down	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	we	show	for	the	first	time	that	<RNA_Name>	act	as	a	suppressor	of	emt	in	diabetic	nephropathy	through	repress	pi3k-akt	signal	pathway	activation	by	target	<Protein_Name>	which	maybe	a	potential	therapeutic	target	for	diabetes-induced	renal	dysfunction	
interestingly	all	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	mimic	test	decreased	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	but	this	downregulation	be	most	profound	with	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	experiment	define	<Protein_Name>	as	a	target	of	mir-802-dependent	post-transcriptional	silencing	in	liver	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	
these	result	provide	further	evidence	that	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	respective	bona	fide	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	in	human	cell	
our	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	interact	with	the	<Protein_Name>	and	the	low	level	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	glioma	may	be	one	of	the	reason	for	the	abnormal	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	which	lead	to	aberrant	dna	methylation	contribute	to	the	development	of	human	glioma	
collectively	these	data	indicate	that	the	down-regulated	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	relate	to	high	level	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	which	may	be	associate	the	development	of	glioma	and	support	the	notion	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	dmnt1	mrna	thereby	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	glioma	cell	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	interact	with	the	<Protein_Name>	and	the	low	level	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	promote	the	abnormal	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	glioma	
<RNA_Name>	suppresses	<Protein_Name>	to	protect	against	the	apoptosis	of	neural	progenitor	cell	the	
over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	decrease	apoptosis	in	npc	and	the	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	remarkably	increase	the	number	of	tunel-positive	npc	by	<Number>	in	response	to	hypoxia	
the	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	far	examine	by	evaluate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	the	human	escc	cell	line	eca109	and	kyse-410	after	the	overexpression	and	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	decrease	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	significantly	and	the	knockdownof	<RNA_Name>	increase	the	level	ofnfixmrna	inversely	theseresultsdemonstrated	
that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	decrease	the	stability	of	mrna	
this	finding	suggest	that	the	putative	mirna	bind	site	of	<Protein_Name>	be	strongly	responsible	for	this	mirna-mrna	interaction	
the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	dna	<Protein_Name>	3a	be	identify	in	silico	and	validate	use	a	3'utr	reporter	assay	
<Protein_Name>	-mediated	<RNA_Name>	down-regulation	and	<Protein_Name>	up-regulation	support	the	enhanced	dna	methylation	of	several	tumor-suppressor	gene	in	hbx-expressing	cell	
further	study	involve	loss	and	gain	of	function	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	specifier	like	sox-	<Number>	and	sox-	<Number>	be	direct	target	of	mir-	<Number>	and	mir-	<Number>	respectively	and	that	they	be	essentially	modulate	by	metformin	
take	together	our	result	confirm	that	metformin	modulate	mir-	<Number>	and	mir-	<Number>	which	directly	target	sox-	<Number>	and	sox-	<Number>	the	chief	<Protein_Name>	determinant	
we	also	establish	for	the	first	time	that	mir-	<Number>	target	sox-	<Number>	during	nc	development	and	misregulation	of	sox-	<Number>	be	also	witness	in	zebrafish	
<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	downregulated	in	both	sw480	and	ht29	cell	by	<RNA_Name>	
western	blot	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	through	the	identified	binding	site	in	their	3'utr	
this	coincide	with	sequestration	of	<RNA_Name>	in	a	slower-migrating	heteroduplex	with	antimir-21	de-repression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	with	canonical	<RNA_Name>	seed	match	site	and	upregulation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	target	protein31	
more	recently	we	have	report	that	microrna-296-5p	be	identify	to	play	a	tumor	suppressive	role	by	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	of	prostate	cancer	in	addition	<RNA_Name>	be	recently	find	to	be	progres	sively	lose	during	tumor	progression	in	various	cancer	include	crc	
to	understand	the	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	crc	we	first	analyze	the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	<RNA_Name>	in	crc	cell	line	by	western	blot	and	quantitative	rt-pcr	analysis	
these	result	be	consistent	with	our	previous	study	show	that	<RNA_Name>	play	a	tumor-suppressive	role	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
the	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	far	examine	by	evaluate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	the	human	escc	cell	line	after	the	overexpression	and	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	
this	finding	suggest	that	the	putative	mirna	bind	site	of	<Protein_Name>	be	responsible	for	this	mirna-mrna	interaction	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	decrease	the	stability	of	mrna	
spot42	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expressionpost-transcriptionally	
we	find	that	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	decrease	significantly	in	cell	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	compare	to	cell	transfected	with	scramble	
western	blot	show	that	<Protein_Name>	level	be	positively	correlate	with	the	increase	concentration	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	far	indicating	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
our	western	blot	and	luciferase	reporter	assay	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	at	the	posttranscriptional	level	
<RNA_Name>	could	potentially	form	base	pair	with	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	suggest	that	it	may	act	as	an	antisense	regulator	
since	the	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	gene	be	locate	at	different	genetic	locus	and	be	produce	from	two	separate	transcriptional	unit	the	situation	strongly	mimic	the	<RNA_Name>	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	similarity	encourage	us	to	test	the	hypothesis	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
among	many	mirnas	that	be	predict	to	target	<Protein_Name>	we	show	use	various	experimental	approach	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	could	target	both	human	<Protein_Name>	and	mouse	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
to	investigate	if	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	in	insulin-secreting	cell	we	overexpressed	the	micrornas	and	measure	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
reporter	assay	confirm	the	direct	binding	and	repression	of	<RNA_Name>	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
<RNA_Name>	regulates	epc	function	via	target	<Protein_Name>	
generally	speak	our	research	disclose	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	epc	activity	in	<Protein_Name>	patient	via	target	<Protein_Name>	
use	a	bioinformatics	method	we	further	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	its	protein	level	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
therefore	the	data	report	in	this	manuscript	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	an	important	regulator	in	breast	cancer	and	imply	that	the	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	axis	have	potential	as	a	therapeutic	target	for	breast	cancer	
because	premir-203	reduce	<Protein_Name>	expression	during	sp	exposure	these	data	confirm	the	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
<RNA_Name>	may	regulate	expression	of	the	novel	nociceptive	mediator	<Protein_Name>	after	incision	
expression	of	<Protein_Name>	after	sp	exposure	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	line	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
mock-	or	klf2-transduced	huvecs	be	co-cultured	with	untreated	smcs	for	<Number>	h	and	the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	analyse	by	real-time	pcr	
mouse	endothelial	cell	be	isolate	from	wild-type	or	<RNA_Name>	145-deficient	mouse	and	be	incubate	with	smcs	
mature	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	coordinately	express	and	both	directly	targetthe	pai-1	3'utr	lead	to	reduce	pai-1	mrna	and	protein	level	
thus	the	direct	comparison	of	mirna	and	mrna	level	in	tissue	sample	and	to	some	degree	in	cell	line	confirm	that	expression	of	pai-1	and	<RNA_Name>	-145	be	mutually	exclusive	
however	downregulation	of	pai-1	expression	by	<RNA_Name>	and	-145	be	also	confirm	in	other	cancer	cell	line	include	h1299	<Protein_Name>	and	u251	thereby	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	-145-directed	repression	of	pai-1	be	not	restrict	to	bladder	cancer	
<Protein_Name>	activator	inhibitor-1	mrna	be	significantly	enrich	upon	<RNA_Name>	and	-145	transfection	compare	with	negative	control	suggest	direct	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	-145	<Protein_Name>	complex	and	pai-1	mrna	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	through	bind	to	their	respective	predict	<RNA_Name>	target	site	in	their	3'-utrs	
to	determine	whether	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	or	<Protein_Name>	gene	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	quantitative	rt-pcr	analysis	be	carry	out	in	retrovirally	transduced	mutu	i	cell

further	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	be	low	in	mir-155-transduced	mutu	i	cell	
<Protein_Name>	and	e-cadherin	as	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	
in	this	study	we	confirm	that	bone	morphogenetic	protein	receptor	ii	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	also	show	that	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	correlate	inversely	with	the	amount	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	and	lncap	cell	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	bind	to	not	only	the	two	downstream	conserve	bind	site	but	also	the	two	upstream	predict	binding	site	
take	together	these	result	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
further	study	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
herein	we	report	that	<RNA_Name>	be	significantly	suppress	in	human	breast	cancer	specimen	and	cancer	cell	line	and	the	mirna	suppress	breast	cancer	progression	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
overall	these	result	suggest	<Protein_Name>	be	the	potential	functional	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
our	finding	show	that	when	either	of	two	bind	site	in	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	be	mutate	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	be	completely	eliminate	
take	together	these	data	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
our	result	show	<Protein_Name>	induction	can	rescue	the	tumorsuppressive	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
therefore	the	tumor-suppressive	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	be	regulate	through	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	control	<Protein_Name>	level	by	translational	suppression	rather	than	by	mrna	degradation	
therefore	it	support	our	hypothesis	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	via	the	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	ubiquitination-promoting	complex	<Number>	suppressor	of	cytokine	signal	<Number>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
consistent	with	this	silencing	of	<RNA_Name>	in	mdcs	result	in	increased	socs-1	expression	at	protein	level	whereas	force	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	reduce	socs-1	expression	in	imdcs	in	addition	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	reduce	along	with	<RNA_Name>	up-regulation	during	dc	maturation	
take	together	these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	indirectly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>

from	the	comprehensive	mirna	expression	analysis	of	hcc	tissue	pair	with	adjacent	non-cancerous	hepatic	tissue	<RNA_Name>	be	identify	to	repress	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	hcc	cell	
take	together	the	result	show	that	<Protein_Name>	stimulate	by	<Protein_Name>	lead	to	c-jun	activation	and	the	transcriptional	activation	of	<RNA_Name>	which	elevate	<RNA_Name>	expression	play	a	critical	role	in	suppress	<Protein_Name>	in	hcc	cell	
<Protein_Name>	be	identify	as	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	be	downregulated	in	pdac	specimen	
to	further	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	in	pdac	cell	
thus	our	data	strongly	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	pdac	
remarkably	we	find	that	the	tumor	suppressor	<Protein_Name>	have	the	most	reduced	activity	which	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	likely	to	be	an	important	target	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	leukemia	
this	finding	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	leukemic	cell	and	that	the	putative	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	be	critical	for	<RNA_Name>	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	result	strongly	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	pediatric	<Protein_Name>	
furthermore	we	infer	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	thereby	modulate	the	susceptibility	of	leukemic	cell	to	apoptosis	
these	finding	suggest	that	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	may	contribute	to	the	development	of	hcc	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
as	show	in	<Protein_Name>	3e	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	repress	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	wild	type	plasmid	but	not	the	mutant	plasmid	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	observation	suggest	that	decreased	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	triggered	up-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	partially	in	hcc	
in	<Protein_Name>	cell	<RNA_Name>	directly	reduce	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	at	the	mrna	and	protein	level	which	thereby	promote	expression	of	the	downstream	protein	cyclin	d1	and	increase	s-phase	entry	
luciferase	assay	reveal	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	could	significantly	reduce	luciferase	activity	from	the	reporter	vector	contain	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
our	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	both	putative	targetsites	<Number>	and	<Number>	
we	conclude	that	<Protein_Name>	200b	can	directly	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	vivo

the	present	study	explore	the	role	and	mechanism	of	<RNA_Name>	in	increase	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	up-regulated	modulator	of	apoptosis	and	enhance	the	sensitivity	of	oscc	to	cisplatin	
pre-treatment	with	isdn	reverse	the	decrease	in	<RNA_Name>	expression	induce	by	hg	stimulation	but	have	no	apparent	effect	on	<RNA_Name>	expression	
furthermore	inhibition	of	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	pathway	by	either	pd98059	or	<Protein_Name>	sirna	substantially	abolish	the	recovery	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	follow	pre-treatment	with	isdn	
<Protein_Name>	phosphorylation	and	<Protein_Name>	activity	be	examine	follow	the	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	indicating	that	there	be	no	signficant	change	between	the	control	group	and	the	antagomir	group	both	in	phosphorylated	<Protein_Name>	and	in	<Protein_Name>	expression	mirna-130b	
here	we	have	identify	a	novel	heart-andmuscle-specific	microrna	<RNA_Name>	which	be	activate	by	<Protein_Name>	and	subsequently	downregulates	<Protein_Name>	through	binding	to	its	3'utr	form	a	negative	regulatory	circuit	that	fine-tune	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	level	in	vivo	
<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	through	bind	to	conserve	<RNA_Name>	target	site	on	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
mutation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	targeting	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	largely	abolish	this	inhibition	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	binding	to	the	two	conserve	<RNA_Name>	targeting	site	
these	result	indicate	that	the	<RNA_Name>	sponge	could	efficiently	compete	with	the	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	target	site	include	the	one	in	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	subsequently	release	the	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	cause	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	rescue	experiment	suggest	that	one	essential	role	of	<RNA_Name>	be	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	level	
luciferase	assay	and	western	blot	analysis	demonstrate	that	the	<RNA_Name>	200c	<Number>	family	recognize	the	<Protein_Name>	in	the	3'utr	of	ap-2alpha	gene	and	negatively	regulate	the	expression	of	endogenous	ap-2alpha	protein	
amongst	these	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	validate	as	direct	target	of	the	<RNA_Name>	family	
we	also	discover	that	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	hasm	cell	depend	on	<Protein_Name>	expression	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	be	directly	relate	to	the	decrease	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	hasm	cell	
<RNA_Name>	significantly	downregulated	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	the	hasm	cell	and	the	low	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	depend	on	the	level	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	reduces	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	type	ii	receptor	expression	during	emt	
4c	and	d	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	induced	expression	of	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	type	ii	receptorin	hk-2	cell	undergo	emt	whereas	enhancement	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	inhibit	the	expression	of	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	type	ii	receptor	
these	data	suggest	that	the	inhibitory	effect	of	the	<RNA_Name>	cluster	in	tgf	--	beta1-induced	emt	of	hk-2	cell	may	be	due	to	the	reduced	activity	of	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	signaling	and	the	associated	decrease	in	expression	of	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	type	ii	receptor	
we	far	identify	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	3'-untranslated	region	and	repress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	for	the	first	time	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	promotes	escc	cell	migration	and	invasion	by	suppress	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	addition	we	uncover	an	inverse	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	escc	cell	line	
furthermore	<Protein_Name>	reverse	cell	migration	and	invasion	induce	by	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	function	as	a	mediator	of	<RNA_Name>	in	cell	migration	and	invasion	
our	study	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	the	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	by	target	its	3'utr	which	add	a	new	explanation	of	deregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	escc	
the	expression	pattern	be	inversed	with	<RNA_Name>	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	might	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	vivo	
in	addition	<Protein_Name>	but	not	<Protein_Name>	and	ch2	significantly	reduce	tumor	necrosis	factor	alpha-	timulated	expression	of	the	<RNA_Name>	target	vcam-1	to	a	similar	extent	as	<RNA_Name>	mimic	transfection	
<Protein_Name>	be	confirm	to	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	luciferase	reporter	and	western	blot	assay	
figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	by	inhibit	translation	
thus	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	whose	upregulation	promote	<Protein_Name>	-induced	breast	cancer	cell	invasion	and	migration	
furthermore	we	detect	the	downregulation	of	the	protein	level	of	cyclin	g1	with	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	
cyclin	g1	be	the	known	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	mrna	3'-utrs	depicting	target	bind	site	for	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	
these	result	far	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	and	that	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	promote	glioma	cell	invasion	and	angiogenesis	at	least	in	part	by	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	
interestingly	a	significant	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	be	observe	in	the	cell	transfected	with	the	<RNA_Name>	with	respect	to	the	scramble	oligonucleotide	whereas	sdf-1alpha	mrna	expression	level	be	unchanged	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	affect	<Protein_Name>	protein	synthesis	by	facilitate	the	specific	degradation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
we	also	show	that	<RNA_Name>	transfection	down-regulates	the	luciferase	activity	of	a	reporter	construct	carry	the	3'utr-cxcr4	or	3'utr-sdf-1alpha	sequence	and	the	mutation	in	the	putative	3'utr	site	inhibit	the	sensitivity	of	the	reporter	construct	to	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	and	sdf-1alpha	be	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
a	and	f	schematic	representation	of	the	3'utr	site	of	the	<Protein_Name>	and	sdf-1alpha	gene	target	by	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	and	sdf-1alpha	protein	expression	be	inversely	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	goiter	fa	ftc	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	tissue	
furthermore	by	use	luciferase	assay	we	find	that	both	overexpression	and	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	induce	a	significant	change	of	vegf-a	luciferase	activity	which	demonstrate	that	vegf-a	be	also	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	biliary	epithelial	cell	
we	find	that	after	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	there	be	an	increase	in	<Protein_Name>	expression	compare	with	control-transfected	cell	
<Number>	the	<RNA_Name>	precursor	dramatically	decrease	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	mrna	while	there	be	no	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	mrna	level	
the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	suppress	more	than	the	mrna	level	by	<RNA_Name>	transfection	imply	that	mr-34a	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	
the	result	show	that	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	be	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	transfection	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	interact	with	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	but	not	with	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	find	to	be	a	target	for	<RNA_Name>	
the	intact	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	clone	into	luciferase	reporter	plasmid	which	be	use	for	co-transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	or	as-mir-449c	into	snu	<Number>	cell	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	significantly	reduce	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	3'utr	reporter	for	<Protein_Name>	while	as-mir-449c	significantly	increase	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	3'utr	reporter	for	<Protein_Name>	the	mir-449c-mediated	change	in	<Protein_Name>	transcript	level	be	far	find	to	alter	protein	level	
thus	our	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	function	at	least	partially	via	<Protein_Name>	
luciferase	reporter	assay	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
altogether	our	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	be	show	to	inhibit	proliferation	and	invasion	of	oc	cell	through	suppression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	act	as	a	tumor	suppressor	in	some	malignancy	while	its	role	in	hcc	be	unclear	
<Protein_Name>	transcription	factor	<Number>	be	identify	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	cell	
moreover	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	partially	attenuate	the	tumor	suppressive	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	and	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	negatively	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	level	in	hcc	tissue	
our	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	might	suppress	the	growth	and	motility	of	hcc	cell	partially	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	cyclin-dependent	kinase	<Number>	and	monocyte	chemoattractant	protein	<Number>	mrna	and	the	induction	of	<RNA_Name>	in	ra	synoviocytes	significantly	suppress	the	production	of	the	cdk-2	and	mcp-1	protein	
subsequent	luciferase	assay	show	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	suppress	the	luciferase	activity	drive	by	the	3'utr	of	mcp-1	mrna	
a	luciferase	reporter	assay	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	suppress	the	reporter	activity	drive	by	the	3'utr	of	cdk-2	mrna	but	not	reporter	drive	by	the	mutant	of	3'utr	of	cdk-2	mrna	
we	also	find	that	cdk-6	protein	another	cdk	that	regulate	the	g1-s	phase	be	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	
our	data	point	toward	an	important	role	for	<RNA_Name>	in	the	regulation	of	pro-inflammatory	cytokine	release	by	control	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	ra	<Protein_Name>	
altogether	these	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	conserved	direct	target	for	post-transcriptional	regulation	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	at	the	translational	level	
this	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
microarray	and	bioinformatic	analysis	identify	the	novel	oncogene	macrophage	migration	inhibitory	factor	as	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	fact	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	down-regulated	mrna	and	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	decreased	expression	of	reporter	gene	with	<Protein_Name>	target	sequence	
moreover	we	find	a	significant	inverse	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	tumoral	gastric	biopsy	
accordingly	over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	could	significantly	suppress	the	luciferase	activity	of	reporter	fusion	with	the	bind	site	of	<Protein_Name>	in	its	3'utr	region	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	play	its	role	in	lps-induced	lung	inflammation	by	a	direct	manner	
it	have	be	previously	report	that	mirna	regulate	the	expression	of	the	targetmrnas	by	bind	its	3'utr	thus	the	3'utr	of	either	il-6	or	<Protein_Name>	be	clone	into	psicheck2	vector	and	the	result	show	that	over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	could	significantly	suppress	the	luciferase	activity	of	reporter	fusion	with	the	bind	site	of	<Protein_Name>	in	its	3'utr	region	but	that	it	could	not	suppress	that	of	il-6	suggest	a	direct	action	of	<RNA_Name>	in	lps-induced	lung	inflammation	
luciferase	activity	assay	show	that	<RNA_Name>	mimic	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	the	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	via	bind	to	the	<Number>	'	-utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
importantly	our	study	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	functioning	as	a	<Protein_Name>	suppressor	reverse	bcrp-mediated	drug	resistance	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	
compare	with	the	negative	control	<RNA_Name>	mimic	significantly	inhibited	luciferase	activity	in	mcf-7	mx	cell	suggest	that	the	<Number>	'	-utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	target	site	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	but	not	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	significantly	decrease	in	cell	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	comparedto	cell	transfected	with	negative	control	
suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	expression	
to	far	confirm	the	specificity	of	3'utr	sequence	target	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	luciferase	reporter	construct	contain	mutant	3'utr	be	construct	
luciferase	reporter	gene	activity	of	these	mutant	be	not	affect	by	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	associate	with	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	andcdc6	to	repress	their	protein	expression	
we	observe	that	suppression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	clearly	increased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	although	its	effect	on	brdu	incorporation	be	not	clear	
further	study	be	need	to	demonstrate	whether	or	not	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	sufficient	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	to	induce	cell	proliferation	by	mediate	<Protein_Name>	action	
collectively	our	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	bona	fide	negative	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	during	bovine	early	embryogenesis	
figure	<Number>	prediction	of	a	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	the	3'utr	of	bovine	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
thus	the	inverse	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	activity	support	the	proposed	role	of	<RNA_Name>	as	a	physiological	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	during	early	embryogenesis	
these	result	unequivocally	show	that	bovine	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	by	<RNA_Name>	and	further	support	the	hypothesis	that	<RNA_Name>	be	responsible	for	the	negative	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	indicate	the	predicted	<Protein_Name>	be	critical	for	the	direct	and	specific	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	to	<Protein_Name>	transcript	
thus	a	similar	mechanism	be	likely	to	be	involve	in	the	<RNA_Name>	negative	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	bovine	embryo	during	<Protein_Name>	
functional	<RNA_Name>	binding	to	pdgf-c	and	igf-i	mrna	sequence	but	not	to	the	corresponding	mutant	be	then	prove	by	reporter	assay	
our	<RNA_Name>	binding	study	and	expression	data	of	mir-29-treated	<Protein_Name>	clearly	demonstrate	that	the	growth	factor	pdgf-c	and	igf-i	be	tightly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>

4f	<RNA_Name>	significantly	suppress	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	both	cell	line	and	this	suppression	be	through	post-transcriptional	regulation	because	<RNA_Name>	over-expression	do	not	reduce	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	
this	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	pair	with	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	t3	at	312-380	nucleotide	upstream	from	the	start	codon	
study	of	<RNA_Name>	deletion	indicate	that	the	transcription	factor	encode	by	<Protein_Name>	be	a	key	direct	target	as	<Protein_Name>	be	misexpressed	in	<RNA_Name>	clone	and	<Protein_Name>	heterozygosity	can	suppress	certain	<RNA_Name>	mutant	phenotype

these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	we	suggest	this	could	lead	to	an	increase	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	turnover	and	decreased	<Protein_Name>	protein	synthesis	
consistent	with	observation	use	the	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	neuronal	cell	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	decrease	luciferase	reporter	activity	in	cell	transfected	with	construct	contain	the	wild-type	<RNA_Name>	binding	sequence	in	the	luciferase	3'utr	
here	we	report	that	<RNA_Name>	c	and	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	modulate	by	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	receptor	and	<RNA_Name>	-203	control	only	by	<Protein_Name>	play	important	role	in	gefitinib-induced	apoptosis	and	epithelial-mesenchymal	transition	of	nsclc	cell	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	by	inhibit	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	apaf-1	pkc-	and	<Protein_Name>	gene	
luciferase	reporter	assay	show	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	bind	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	homolog	mrna	3'-untranslated	region	implicate	<Protein_Name>	as	a	targetgene	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	inverse	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	level	in	thp-1	cell	or	monocyte	treat	with	age	as	well	as	monocyte	from	<Protein_Name>	patient	far	support	the	conclusion	that	monocytic	<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	the	targetgenes	of	<RNA_Name>	
furthermore	the	effect	of	bsa-ages	on	serum	deprivation-induced	thp-1	cell	apoptosis	be	largely	abolish	by	transfecting	thp-1	cell	with	anti-mir-214	implying	that	the	role	of	bsa-ages	in	delay	monocyte	apoptosis	be	through	modulation	of	mir-214-targeting	<Protein_Name>	
microrna-18a	and	microrna-421	both	of	which	target	<Protein_Name>	be	positively	control	by	<Protein_Name>	signal	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	positively	control	by	mtor-mediated	signaling	pathway	
thus	the	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	might	contribute	to	at	least	in	part	the	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	solid	pediatric	tumor	xenograft	
furthermore	the	result	of	luciferase	assay	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	directly	target	3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	
by	perform	luciferase	assay	and	the	evaluate	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	on	different	3'-utrs	we	identify	a	significant	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	down-regulation	of	luciferase	activity	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
recently	<Protein_Name>	be	report	to	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	research	of	tumor	metastasis	
therefore	we	examine	the	effect	of	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	hscs	
follow	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	hscs	be	decrease	by	<Number>	and	<Number>	test	by	qrt-pcr	and	western	blot	assay	respectively	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	hscs	
<RNA_Name>	have	be	characterize	as	direct	<Protein_Name>	target	which	induce	apoptosis	cell	cycle	arrest	and	senescence	
thus	far	there	be	no	study	on	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	osteosarcoma	
and	<Protein_Name>	also	partially	contribute	to	the	<RNA_Name>	induce	cell	cycle	arrest	and	apoptosis	
luciferase	reporter	gene	assay	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	via	an	mir-199a-binding	site	in	the	3'utr	
the	luciferase	activity	of	the	report	gene	with	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	significantly	inhibit	by	<RNA_Name>	whereas	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	report	gene	with	the	mutate	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	not	affect	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	can	target	<Protein_Name>	mrna	by	specifically	bind	to	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
these	data	indicate	that	exogenous	<RNA_Name>	downregulated	the	expression	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	ovarian	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	imply	that	reduced	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	via	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	could	significantly	attenuate	the	invasion	and	migration	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	ovarian	<Protein_Name>	
herefore	reduce	expression	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	in	cell	overexpressing	<RNA_Name>	influence	the	stemness	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	ovarian	<Protein_Name>	in	conclusion	we	report	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	and	reduce	the	proliferation	and	invasion	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	ovarian	cancer	stem	cell	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	
hence	an	association	be	establish	between	<RNA_Name>	downregulation	and	<Protein_Name>	upregulation	in	dr	
these	result	establish	a	direct	regulatory	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	on	hg-induced	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	its	functional	consequence	
mutate	targetsequence	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	also	not	responsive	to	<RNA_Name>	
the	expression	of	two	of	the	know	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	highly	reduce	in	pi	treat	as	well	as	<RNA_Name>	over-expressing	vsmcs	
finally	we	show	strong	reduction	in	the	expression	of	two	of	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	which	have	establish	role	in	vsmc	biology	
figure	<Number>	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	up-	and	down	regulation	and	pi	on	<RNA_Name>	specific	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	find	downregulated	and	<RNA_Name>	upregulated	in	human	pancreatic	adenocarcinoma	tissue	
neither	<Protein_Name>	expression	level	nor	nf-kappab	reporter	activity	be	affect	by	<RNA_Name>	indicating	that	the	complementation	of	3-	part	of	<RNA_Name>	to	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	essential	for	nkrf-negative	regulation	
thus	we	conclude	that	the	interaction	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	represent	a	3-	compensatory	site	and	the	first	one	with	two	g	u	pair	
these	result	indicate	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	and	that	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	be	dependent	on	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
this	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	targetother	gene	beyond	<Protein_Name>	to	regulate	nf-kappab	activation	
take	together	our	finding	suggest	that	ebv	encode	<RNA_Name>	mirna	target	<Protein_Name>	tumor	suppressor	to	promote	cellular	growth	and	transformation	in	npc	enforced	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	or	its	precursor	pre-mir-bart3	lead	to	down-regulation	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	expression	
collectively	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	inhibit	the	<Protein_Name>	-beta-catenin	signal	by	reduce	the	frizzled	<Number>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	breast	cscs	
human	hd	cortex	have	increase	level	of	the	mir-132-targetmrna	<Protein_Name>	
our	find	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	in	a	heterologous	reporter	system	and	that	an	intact	seed	sequence	be	require	for	mir132-mediated	repression	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	<RNA_Name>	target	this	finding	be	confirm	by	show	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hippocampal	neuron	down-regulated	endogenous	<Protein_Name>

all	mirnas	inhibit	reporter	activity	in	assay	with	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	include	<RNA_Name>	
among	them	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	have	be	already	validate	as	direct	<RNA_Name>	target	
figure2	show	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	selectively	result	in	downregulation	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	cardiomyocytes	and	skeletal	myoblasts	whereas	no	significant	change	be	observe	upon	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	
interestingly	selectively	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	atrial	cardiomyocytes	but	not	in	sol8	skeletal	muscle	myoblasts	as	illustrate	in	figure3	
use	gene-expression	analysis	reporter	gene	assay	and	chromatin-immunoprecipitation	approach	we	present	definitive	evidence	that	the	abundance	of	the	three-member	<RNA_Name>	family	be	directly	regulate	by	<Protein_Name>	in	cell	line	and	tissue	
<RNA_Name>	act	as	a	sequence-specific	translational	initiation	inhibitor	by	target	the	ss-1	region	of	the	<Protein_Name>	5'-utr	
these	abnormality	can	be	attribute	at	least	in	part	to	elevate	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	cyclin	d2	which	be	target	for	repression	by	<RNA_Name>	
the	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	by	<Protein_Name>	and	the	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	provide	a	negative	feedback	loop	to	precisely	titrate	the	action	of	<Protein_Name>	such	that	elevation	of	<Protein_Name>	activity	enhance	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	with	consequent	dampening	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
<RNA_Name>	be	specifically	underexpressed	in	hpv-positive	cell	line	cervical	lesion	and	cancer	tissue	contain	hpv-16	dna	compare	to	both	c-33a	and	the	normal	cervix	expression	of	the	e6	oncogene	of	high-risk	hpv-16	but	not	that	of	low-risk	hpv-6	reduce	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	conversely	rna	interference	of	e6	e7	oncogene	in	an	hpv-16-positive	cell	line	increase	<RNA_Name>	expression	
we	also	demonstrate	that	the	epithelial	cell-specific	marker	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	also	show	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	increase	in	the	presence	of	the	hpv-16	e6	oncogene	and	this	effect	be	mediate	through	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	guide	cleavage	within	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	by	virtue	of	its	complete	complementarity	to	its	target	
transfecting	cell	with	the	r11-sspei	<RNA_Name>	complex	show	that	ectopic	<RNA_Name>	in	human	prostate	cancer	significantly	repress	the	luciferase	activity	of	reporter	plasmid	carry	the	<Protein_Name>	c-myc	igf-ir	and	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	these	result	give	above	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	decrease	hif-1	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	the	expression	of	hif-1alpha	and	<Protein_Name>	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	initial	experiment	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
use	<RNA_Name>	as	bait	two	of	its	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	capture	
<RNA_Name>	overproduction	result	in	reduced	amount	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	correspond	outer	membrane	protein	
the	absence	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	itself	allow	survival	to	<Protein_Name>	depletion	independently	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	author	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	a	putative	microrna	regulatory	element	in	the	3'-	untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	these	data	suggest	that	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	present	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	critical	for	mir-145-mediated	gene	regulation	
the	inverse	correlation	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	coordinately	regulate	in	the	development	of	tumor	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	by	function	on	translational	regulation	
if	we	consider	<Protein_Name>	a	correct	prediction	<Number>	out	of	<Number>	prediction	for	<RNA_Name>	be	support	by	the	microarray	data	
take	together	these	result	identify	<Protein_Name>	mrna	as	a	genuine	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	in	primary	rat	neuron	
intriguingly	other	<Protein_Name>	receptor	lack	canonical	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	their	3'-utrs	suggesting	that	<RNA_Name>	selectively	target	<Protein_Name>	for	translational	repression	
these	all	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	combine	with	the	specific	<Protein_Name>	mrna	3'utr	binding	site	and	play	a	role	in	inhibit	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	
all	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	through	mrna	cleavage	mechanism	at	the	post-transcriptional	level

<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	to	suppress	its	expression	
our	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	a	posttranscriptional	mechanism	
thus	our	data	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	transcript	
altogether	our	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	represses	<Protein_Name>	and	its	downstream	signal	through	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	in	pc	cell	
our	finding	thus	suggest	that	mir-150-mediated	inhibition	of	growth	and	clonogenicity	in	pc	cell	may	in	part	be	due	to	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
our	study	confirm	the	clinical	relevance	of	our	experimental	data	on	mir-150-mediated	<Protein_Name>	regulation	in	pc	cell	
furthermore	our	result	provide	an	evidence	for	a	clinical	correlation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	a	small	subset	of	malignant	pancreatic	tissue	whereas	<Protein_Name>	in	normal	pancreas	primarily	seem	to	be	regulate	by	transcriptional	mechanism	
by	use	bioinformatics	analysis	we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	one	of	<Number>	differentially	express	mirnas	may	target	aconitate	hydratase	heat	shock	protein	a5	and	ubiquitin	carboxyl-terminal	<Protein_Name>	isozyme	l1	among	<Number>	change	protein	kinase	c	isoform-specific	interacting	protein	in	hpc	mouse	brain	
by	use	a	t7	promoter-driven	control	dual	luciferase	assay	we	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	could	bind	to	the	3'-untranslated	rergions	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	repress	their	translation	
these	result	suggest	that	the	downregulated	<RNA_Name>	induces	neuroprotection	against	ischemic	injury	through	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	provide	a	potential	therapeutic	target	for	ischemic	stroke

this	be	the	first	study	show	that	<RNA_Name>	can	function	as	an	oncogene	by	target	<Protein_Name>	in	the	osteosarcoma	<Protein_Name>	cell	line	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	can	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
importantly	our	data	show	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulated	the	expression	of	c-myc	and	<Protein_Name>	which	have	previously	be	identify	as	two	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
moreover	<RNA_Name>	mimic	could	enhance	the	cell	growth	inhibition	and	apoptosis	induction	impact	of	various	<Protein_Name>	target	agent	
in	conclusion	<RNA_Name>	play	a	vital	role	in	the	cell	growth	and	apoptosis	of	hcc	cell	and	induce	<RNA_Name>	level	might	be	a	critical	targeted	molecular	therapy	strategy	for	hcc	
we	find	the	microrna	<RNA_Name>	binding	to	three	different	motif	of	the	3'utr	mrna	<Protein_Name>	region	
as	show	in	figure	2a-c	<Protein_Name>	level	be	decrease	as	a	function	of	time	after	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	treatment	and	this	decrease	correlate	with	an	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	be	find	to	regulate	several	important	gene	include	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	cyclin-dependent	kinase	<Number>	dna	-methyltransferase	<Number>	b-cell	leukemia	lymphoma	<Number>	
thus	<RNA_Name>	regulate	<Protein_Name>	by	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
therefore	we	focus	on	the	affect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	glioma	cell	invasion	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
low	expression	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	significantly	associate	with	a	short	overall	survival	
together	these	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	can	inhibit	glioma	cell	invasion	by	increase	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	directly	as	well	as	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	indirectly	both	in	vivo	and	in	vitro	
inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	yield	the	opposite	result	in	addition	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	increase	the	sensitivity	of	skov3	cddp	and	ovcar3	cddp	cell	to	cddp	and	inhibit	their	colony	number	
<Protein_Name>	be	validate	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	skov3	ovcar3	skov3	cddp	and	ovcar3	cddp	cell	in	addition	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	by	bind	site	on	its	3'utr	
knockdown	of	<Protein_Name>	result	in	a	similar	effect	as	that	because	of	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	importantly	<Protein_Name>	silence	rescue	the	function	induce	by	<RNA_Name>	
here	we	mainly	focus	on	<RNA_Name>	to	further	investigate	the	interaction	between	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	gc	cell	
these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	bind	to	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	could	function	as	a	cerna	in	gc	cell	
to	validate	whether	<RNA_Name>	target	bcl-2	in	gc	immunoblotting	assay	be	carry	out	and	show	that	bcl-2	be	about	2-fold	high	in	hgc-27	cell	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	compare	with	the	control	
because	<Protein_Name>	share	regulatory	<RNA_Name>	with	bcl-2	mrna	we	wonder	whether	<Protein_Name>	could	modulate	bcl-2	in	gc	cell	
all	these	result	suggest	an	important	role	of	<Protein_Name>	in	modulate	bcl-2	by	competitively	bind	<RNA_Name>	
to	investigate	whether	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	could	bind	directly	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	to	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	we	clone	these	mirnas	target	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	into	the	luciferase	express	pgl3-control	vector	just	downstream	of	the	luciferase	open	reading	frame	4a	combination	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	synergistically	downregulated	<Protein_Name>	reporter	activity	4b	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	impair	<Protein_Name>	mrna	translation	by	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	the	targetgene	for	<RNA_Name>	as	the	<Protein_Name>	repress	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	interact	with	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
by	western	blot	analysis	ectopic	<RNA_Name>	expression	result	in	a	reduction	and	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	lead	to	an	elevation	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	siha	cell	
this	confirm	the	target	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	mrna	it	also	verify	that	the	influence	of	<RNA_Name>	on	cell	migration	in	human	cervical	carcinoma	cell	be	through	<Protein_Name>	the	result	suggest	the	role	of	<Protein_Name>	in	the	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	in	siha	cell	
this	support	the	involvement	of	<Protein_Name>	in	the	hpv-16	e6	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	in	siha	cell	
the	<RNA_Name>	direct	targetgenes	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	individually	require	for	endothelial	recruitment	and	metastatic	colonization	be	downstream	of	<RNA_Name>	and	individually	correlate	in	expression	with	human	metastatic	progression	
these	finding	reveal	that	the	<RNA_Name>	direct	targetgenes	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	individually	require	for	endothelial	recruitment	and	metastatic	colonization	be	downstream	of	<RNA_Name>	and	individually	correlate	in	expression	with	human	metastatic	progression	
<RNA_Name>	target	the	3-	untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	through	a	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	and	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	protein	abundance	at	the	translational	level	
<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	and	improve	hepatic	insulin	sensitivity	
these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	through	its	binding	site	within	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
the	second	gene	<RNA_Name>	be	transcribe	in	the	antisense	orientation	from	the	complementary	strand	of	c6orf4-6	
<RNA_Name>	have	no	apparent	<Protein_Name>	and	most	likely	represent	a	structural	rna	gene	that	be	transcribe	but	not	translate	
this	feature	and	the	antisense	polarity	of	transcription	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	play	a	regulatory	role	on	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	as	indicate	by	a	significant	decrease	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	expression	after	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	cdna	in	human	fibroblast	
neither	<RNA_Name>	nor	c6orf4-6	gene	show	any	homology	with	know	human	gene	
furthermore	caspase-3	be	identify	as	a	novel	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	can	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	and	caspase-3	via	target	the	3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	and	caspase-3	
together	these	result	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	express	in	human	np	and	<RNA_Name>	down-regulated	<Protein_Name>	and	caspase-3	
<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	luciferase	activity	in	reporter	construct	contain	the	<Protein_Name>	3-	-untranslated	region	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	suppress	<Protein_Name>	expression	via	sequence-specific	interaction	with	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	in	the	current	study	we	first	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	repress	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	induces	microtubule	polymerization	where	the	microtubule	be	bundle	nearby	the	boundary	of	the	cell	and	subsequently	modulate	the	sensitivity	of	a	cell	towards	tx	
we	then	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	directly	targetthe	3'untranslated	region	of	the	membrane-bound	complement	regulatory	protein	<Protein_Name>	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	down-regulate	<Protein_Name>	at	post-transcriptional	level	
thus	we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	downregulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	
these	data	elucidate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	targetthe	<Protein_Name>	gene	by	bind	to	the	3'utr	which	further	support	that	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	downregulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	at	post-transcriptional	level	
several	recent	study	have	find	a	conserved	microrna	family	the	<RNA_Name>	to	be	direct	transcriptional	target	of	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	activation	can	recapitulate	element	of	<Protein_Name>	activity	include	induction	of	cell-cycle	arrest	and	promotion	of	apoptosis	and	loss	of	<RNA_Name>	can	impair	p53-mediated	cell	death	
besides	others	this	be	exemplify	for	abundant	asml	wt-exosomal	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	which	target	cadherin-17	
furthermore	a	3'utr	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	luciferase	reporter	assay	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	
we	focus	on	abundant	<RNA_Name>	potentially	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	targeting	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
qrt-pcr	reveal	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	and	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
together	these	result	show	that	<Protein_Name>	contributes	to	the	pathogenesis	of	oa	by	act	as	a	negative	regulator	of	<RNA_Name>	and	thereby	regulate	cell	survival	
the	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	significantly	reduce	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	gc	cell	compare	with	the	control	cell	
these	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
the	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	function	synergistically	with	<Protein_Name>	to	inhibit	gc	cell	migration	and	invasion	activity

the	3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	have	bind	site	for	<RNA_Name>	in	conclusion	these	result	demonstrate	that	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
significant	repression	of	luciferase	activity	be	observe	after	co-transfection	of	pax3-3'utr	with	<RNA_Name>	and	or	-206	precursor	compare	with	scrambled	control	which	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	-206	can	targetpax3	
figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	and	-206	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	sequence-specific	binding	to	its	3'utr	
these	result	indicate	that	both	bind	site	of	<RNA_Name>	and	-206	in	<Protein_Name>	be	functional	and	there	be	minimal	preference	between	these	bind	site	
these	data	also	suggest	that	there	be	no	preferential	selection	between	<RNA_Name>	and	-206	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	at	least	under	the	current	experimental	condition	
the	negative	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	be	strictly	dependent	on	a	microrna	bind	element	in	the	3'utr	of	il-6	mrna	
1a	only	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	expression	vector	significantly	down-regulated	luciferase	activity	compare	with	transfection	with	an	empty	vector	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	potential	regulator	of	il-6	
thus	it	can	be	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	decrease	il-6	expression	by	repress	its	mrna	translation	but	do	not	affect	its	mrna	stability	
these	result	provide	experimental	support	to	the	prediction	that	the	<RNA_Name>	response	element	be	locate	in	the	3'utr	of	il-6	
the	mrna	expression	of	transcription	factor	<Protein_Name>	the	designated	target	of	<RNA_Name>	be	show	to	correlate	inversely	with	the	<RNA_Name>	level	
however	by	compare	mirna	and	mrna	level	it	become	apparent	that	in	<Protein_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	transcript	and	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	transcript	show	a	significant	inverse	correlation	
<RNA_Name>	overexpression	significantly	downregulated	spred-1	in	epcs	
<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	mir-221-222	
we	identify	hepatocyte	growth	factor	receptor	and	forkhead	box	o3	as	new	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	mir-221-222	respectively	
western	blot	analysis	confirm	that	mir-206-expressing	cell	repress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	but	activate	that	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	previously	find	to	be	repress	at	the	mrna	and	protein	level	by	<RNA_Name>	and	mir-221-222	respectively	be	also	find	in	our	list	of	underexpressed	target	
we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	and	that	<RNA_Name>	and	-222	targetfoxo3	by	bind	site	within	the	3'-utrs	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	targetgene	of	the	mature	mir-181s	
the	luciferase	activity	of	a	<Protein_Name>	3'-untranslated	region-based	reporter	construct	in	sgc7901	vcr	and	a549	cddp	cell	suggest	that	a	new	targetsite	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	of	the	mature	mir-181s	be	find	in	sgc7901	vcr	and	a549	cddp	cell	a	significant	decrease	in	relative	luciferase	activity	be	note	when	pgl3-bcl2-3'utr	be	cotransfected	with	the	mature	mir-181s	mimic	but	not	with	the	control	mirna	mimic	respectively	which	suggest	that	the	position	2888-2894	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	also	a	targetsite	by	the	mature	mir-181s	
as	<Protein_Name>	be	an	antiapoptotic	protein	and	a	target	of	the	mature	mir-181s	we	hypothesize	that	the	<RNA_Name>	might	modulate	<Protein_Name>	of	cancer	cell	by	repress	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	modulate	<Protein_Name>	of	cancer	cell	line	at	least	in	part	by	repress	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
in	both	study	<RNA_Name>	negatively	correlate	with	<Protein_Name>	mrna	whereas	<RNA_Name>	be	negatively	correlate	with	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	our	study	
over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	decrease	both	protein	and	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	whereas	inhibit	<RNA_Name>	with	2'-o-methyl-antisense	rna	increase	these	level	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
real-time	pcr	and	western	blot	analysis	show	that	mir-21-overexpressing	hscs	exhibit	less	total	and	phospho-stat3	expression	and	that	anti-mir-21-transfected	hscs	exhibit	increased	<Protein_Name>	expression	
thus	the	observed	change	in	<Protein_Name>	protein	abundance	by	alter	<RNA_Name>	level	the	improvement	of	memory	with	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	and	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	and	result	from	epistasis	experiment	be	consistent	with	the	model	that	the	normal	memory	suppress	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	occur	through	its	regulation	of	the	memory-promoting	gene	<Protein_Name>	
our	behavioral	molecular	cellular	and	genetic	data	together	argue	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	primary	target	of	<RNA_Name>	for	memory	suppression	
<Protein_Name>	identify	as	the	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	to	enhance	m1	and	attenuate	m2	polarization	simultaneously	the	
3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	potential	<RNA_Name>	target	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulated	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	macrophage	through	their	3'-utrs	
in	the	present	study	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	b	regulate	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	bind	with	the	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	of	the	<Protein_Name>	
this	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	repress	<Protein_Name>	transcription	by	direct	binding	to	the	3'utr	
conversely	anti-mir-449a	b	induce	up-regulation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	hcc1436	cell	in	this	study	<RNA_Name>	b	have	low	expression	and	<Protein_Name>	be	over-expressed	in	lung	cancer	
we	observe	substantial	<Protein_Name>	suppression	by	<RNA_Name>	b	at	the	mrna	and	protein	level	in	lung	cancer	
our	finding	indicate	that	the	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	b	result	in	an	up-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	primary	lung	cancer	
moreover	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	b	through	binding	of	the	3'utr	
it	have	be	report	that	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	cause	emt	in	mouse	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	have	anti-fibrotic	effect	in	pulmonary	fibrosis	and	<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	strongly	target	<Protein_Name>	
since	<Protein_Name>	play	a	role	in	the	inhibition	of	cell	cycle	progression	and	inflammatory	cytokine	progression	we	analyze	level	of	<Protein_Name>	--	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	after	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	and	inhibitor	
we	observe	that	the	overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	-132	correspond	positively	with	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	--	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	while	its	inhibition	decrease	their	level	significantly	suggest	that	target	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	prevents	regulation	of	inflammatory	cytokine	production	and	cell	cycle	progression	
therefore	we	investigate	whether	<RNA_Name>	could	decrease	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	transcript	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	reduces	<Protein_Name>	level	largely	by	translational	inhibition	
from	these	data	we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	stabilizes	hif-1alpha	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	thus	indirectly	destabilize	the	component	of	vcbcr	complex	
then	to	examine	whether	<RNA_Name>	actually	downregulates	the	five	gene	or	not	we	perform	real-time	pcr	analysis	of	rna	sample	from	<Number>	<Number>	cell	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	or	control	oligo	and	only	pai-1	mrna	level	be	confirm	to	be	decrease	by	exogenous	<RNA_Name>	expression	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	and	suppresses	gastric	adenocarcinoma	cell	growth	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	show	tumor-suppressive	activity	in	human	gastric	cancer	
in	contrast	egfp	expression	level	with	the	mutate	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	not	influence	by	alteration	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	bindto	the	specific	site	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	3'utr	and	negatively	regulate	the	expression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	in	addition	we	find	that	the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	gastric	adenocarcinoma	tissue	be	significantly	high	than	that	in	match	adjacent	normal	tissue	in	the	<Number>	pair	of	gastric	tissue	
all	of	these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
altogether	<Protein_Name>	as	an	oncogene	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	a	mediator	of	<RNA_Name>	function	in	gastric	cancer	cell	in	summary	we	have	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	downregulated	in	gastric	adenocarcinoma	tissue	and	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	gastric	adenocarcinomacell	viability	and	colony	formation	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
our	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	control	capan-2	cell	proliferation	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
as	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	have	be	report	as	putative	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	in	other	type	of	cancer	cell	<Number>	<Number>	we	assess	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	in	endogenous	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	capan-2	cell	by	western	blot	find	that	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	but	not	<Protein_Name>	be	endogenously	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	mimic	and	inhibitor	
furthermore	<Protein_Name>	another	well-known	target	of	<RNA_Name>	be	not	modify	by	<RNA_Name>	in	capan-2	cell	
the	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	in	capan-2	cell	
the	edu	result	show	that	the	proliferation-suppressing	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	in	capan-2	cell	could	be	partially	reverse	by	silence	<Protein_Name>	4b	indicating	that	<RNA_Name>	promote	capan-2	cell	proliferation	at	least	in	part	via	<Protein_Name>	target	
take	together	this	study	highlight	that	the	<Protein_Name>	effect	of	curcumin	depend	on	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	induction	and	the	p53-mir-192-5p	215-xiap	pathway	be	an	important	therapeutic	target	for	non-small	cell	lung	cancer

t	<Protein_Name>	could	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	in	human	trophoblast-like	cell	
which	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	hypoxia-induced	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	primary	microglial	cell	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	likely	suppress	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	bind	target	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
the	target	gene	be	predict	and	we	use	a	dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	to	demonstrate	that	mir-1and	<RNA_Name>	directlytargeted	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	paired-box	transcription	factor	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	deacetylase	<Number>	
our	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	promote	bovine	skeletal	muscle	satellite	cell	myogenic	differentiation	and	restrict	their	proliferative	potential	by	regulate	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	deacetylase	<Number>	expression	
our	result	show	that	renilla	luciferase	activity	be	downregulated	significantly	when	pax7-3'utr	or	hdac4-3'utr	be	clone	into	the	psicheck-2	vector	which	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	post-transcriptionally	inhibited	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	translation	by	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	or	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	bovine	skeletal	muscle	satellite	cell

the	deletion	of	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	sequence	on	3'utr	prevent	the	pre-mir-122a	inhibition	of	luciferase	activity	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	the	luciferase	activity	by	bind	to	its	complementary	sequence	on	3'utr	
these	result	indicate	that	the	increase	in	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	require	for	the	tnf-alpha	induced	degradation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	increase	in	caco-2	tj	permeability	
these	in-vivo	study	indicate	that	the	tnf-alpha	induced	increase	in	intestinal	permeability	be	associate	with	an	increase	in	enterocyte	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	a	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	level	
<Protein_Name>	be	verify	to	be	one	of	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	through	which	the	epithelial-	esenchymal	transition	and	metastasis	be	inhibit	
this	finding	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	key	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	other	word	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>

this	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	promote	the	formation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	with	<Protein_Name>	and	regulate	<Protein_Name>	post-transcriptionally	
combine	bioinformatics	prediction	and	biochemical	analysis	we	show	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	
moreover	the	<RNA_Name>	level	be	inversely	associate	with	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	breast	cancer	tissue	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	inhibit	breast	cancer	cell	proliferation	and	metastasis	at	least	in	part	by	downregulating	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>

these	result	confirm	the	previous	finding	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	show	that	this	inhibition	occur	in	hepatic	cell	
consistent	with	the	hepg2	cell	study	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	mouseliver	significantly	decrease	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	mouseliver	in	vivo

together	the	data	verify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	regulatory	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	now	report	that	<Protein_Name>	be	upregulated	during	the	progression	of	melanoma	relative	to	benign	nevi	and	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
the	use	of	a	luciferase	reporter	assay	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	by	target	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	post-transcriptionally	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	direct	interaction	with	the	predict	seed-binding	site

these	result	suggest	that	this	site	in	the	3'utr	of	caspase-2	mrna	be	the	direct	interaction	site	with	<RNA_Name>	in	bladder	carcinoma	cell	line	t24	and	<Number>	use	luciferase	assay	and	western	blot	assay	we	find	a	direct	link	between	<RNA_Name>	and	its	putative	target	caspase-2	which	have	be	extensively	verify	to	be	an	apoptosis	inducer	
<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	cooperatively	induce	cellular	senescence	by	target	a	subunit	of	protein	kinase	<Protein_Name>	in	human	colorectal	cancer	cell	
as	a	result	we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	mir-	337-3p	and	<RNA_Name>	could	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	jointly	function	to	repress	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	reduce	the	stability	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	through	specific	targeting	of	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	hct116	cell	
take	together	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	may	induce	senescence	through	<Protein_Name>	inhibition-mediated	ro	generation	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	inhibition-mediated	senescence	can	be	block	by	antisense	inhibitor	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	hct116	cell	
take	together	these	result	strongly	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	jointly	produce	ro	and	induce	senescence	through	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	
<Protein_Name>	4b	show	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	knockdown	and	overexpression	on	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	
we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	induce	a	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	at	mrna	and	protein	level	
furthermore	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	while	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	enhances	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	in	primary	culture	
finally	as	<RNA_Name>	be	upregulated	in	mcao	mouse	and	<Protein_Name>	neuron	we	examine	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	those	condition	and	find	that	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	increase	significantly	in	both	mcao	mouse	and	<Protein_Name>	neuron	
far	we	identify	tumor	suppressor	<Protein_Name>	be	a	novel	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	lung	cancer	cell	and	knockdown	of	<Protein_Name>	in	lung	cancer	cell	in	which	<RNA_Name>	be	inhibit	could	enhance	cell	proliferation	colony	formation	ability	and	anchorage-independent	growth	ability	
take	together	our	result	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	this	study	we	use	lung	ac	cell	line	a549	and	calu-3	to	investigate	the	function	of	<RNA_Name>	in	cell	proliferation	and	find	<Protein_Name>	be	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
this	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	contains	bind	site	for	<RNA_Name>	a	developmentally	restrict	mirna	
to	examine	the	function	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	we	utilize	an	lna-modified	antisense	oligomer	to	inhibit	<RNA_Name>	
uv	irradiation	lead	to	a	dose-dependent	increase	in	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	that	be	suppress	by	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	
there	be	no	significant	difference	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	follow	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	suggest	a	predominant	role	in	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	translation	rather	than	mrna	stability	
together	with	our	data	from	e	cell	this	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	act	to	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	translation	rather	than	the	stability	of	the	mrna	or	protein	
thus	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	attenuate	translation	via	element	find	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
importantly	the	mature	<RNA_Name>	sequence	and	<RNA_Name>	target	sequence	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	conserve	between	human	and	mouse	
<Protein_Name>	a	<Protein_Name>	signaling-related	gene	have	be	implicate	as	a	critical	factor	in	bone	metastasis	and	here	we	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
our	data	show	that	the	bone	metastasis	and	anti-apoptotic	effect	find	in	<Protein_Name>	signaling-activated	prostate	cancer	cell	require	<RNA_Name>	deficiency	which	in	turn	aid	in	cell	survival	by	activate	the	<Protein_Name>	and	anti-apoptotic	signaling	pathway	thereby	induce	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	
<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	regulate	the	stability	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	result	be	consistent	with	our	observation	link	<RNA_Name>	inactivation	to	a	significantly	increase	<Protein_Name>	expression	require	in	oncogenic	wnt-activated	prostate	cancer	
moreover	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulated	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	the	<Protein_Name>	untranslated	region	
in	the	present	work	we	observe	that	<RNA_Name>	suppress	cmm	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	rna	which	consequently	lead	to	inhibition	of	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	pathway	and	decreased	proliferation	
therefore	our	result	determine	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
furthermore	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	suppress	tgf	--	beta-induced	<Protein_Name>	proliferation	and	increase	<Protein_Name>	apoptosis	
bioinformatics	analysis	predict	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	overexpression	in	tgf	--	beta1-treated	<Protein_Name>	do	not	decrease	target	mrna	level	but	significantly	reduce	target	protein	expression	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	function	as	a	novel	regulator	to	modulate	<Protein_Name>	activation	during	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	induction	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
finally	adenomatous	polyposis	coli	which	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	signaling	be	identify	as	the	direct	and	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	activates	<Protein_Name>	-beta-catenin	signaling	by	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	
furthermore	gsk-3-beta	have	a	conservative	<RNA_Name>	seed	sequence	in	its	3'utr	
however	in	both	experiment	there	be	no	significant	change	in	gsk-3-beta	mrna	level	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	predominantly	inhibit	gsk-3-beta	translation	
subsequently	we	confirm	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	gsk-3-beta	translation	
to	determine	whether	<RNA_Name>	indeed	bind	on	gsk-3-beta	3'utr	we	transfected	asmcsdes-	-	with	a	reporter	construct	contain	the	luciferase	gene	<Protein_Name>	to	the	gsk-3-beta	3'utr-beta	
overall	our	data	support	a	model	in	which	loss	of	<Protein_Name>	in	asmcs	up-regulates	<RNA_Name>	that	inhibit	gsk-3-beta	protein	expression	which	in	turn	induces	hypertrophy	by	increase	the	expression	of	smooth	muscle-specific	marker	
knockdown	of	<Protein_Name>	in	hasmcs	also	decrease	gsk-3-beta	protein	expression	and	transfection	of	these	cell	with	mir-26a-antagomir	increased	gsk-3-beta	protein	expression	
in	this	study	we	show	that	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	act	as	direct	negative	regulator	on	the	long	3'utr	<Protein_Name>	isoform	
luciferaseassay	we	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	primate-specific	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	a	rhesus	monkey-specific	target	of	<RNA_Name>	respectively	
we	far	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	valid	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	rhesus	monkey	and	human	but	not	in	rodent	whereas	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	be	rhesus	monkey-specific	
the	up-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	-betatrc	by	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	predict	by	in	silico	analysis	be	consistent	with	the	activation	of	nf-kappab	signal	transduction	in	<RNA_Name>	knockdown	haec	
consistent	with	this	observation	inhibition	of	endogenous	endothelial	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	high	regulation	of	-betatrc	than	<Protein_Name>	at	the	transcriptional	and	translational	level	
<RNA_Name>	recognize	iscu1	<Number>	as	direct	target	for	repression	
nonetheless	through	both	gain-of-function	and	loss-of-function	assay	these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	necessary	and	sufficient	for	the	down-regulation	of	iscu1	<Number>	during	hypoxia	
take	together	with	the	bioinformatic	prediction	and	the	down-regulation	of	endogenous	iscu1	<Number>	by	<RNA_Name>	these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	represses	gene	expression	by	recognize	the	predicted	targetsequence	in	the	3'utr	of	iscu1	<Number>	
the	porin-regulating	srnas	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	form	an	extended	though	imperfect	rna	duplex	with	the	5'-utrs	of	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	respectively	whereas	<Protein_Name>	form	an	almost	perfect	<Number>	bp	duplex	encompass	the	<Protein_Name>	region	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	that	promote	the	multi-chemoresistance	of	the	bladder	cancer	cell	<Protein_Name>	act	as	an	important	executor	for	the	<RNA_Name>	's	positive	impact	on	the	multi-chemoresistance	of	bladder	cancer	probably	via	its	activate	effect	on	dna	damage	response	pathway	
we	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	true	<RNA_Name>	target	gene	in	hl	after	cotransfection	with	anti-mir-155	oligonucleotides	significantly	increase	relative	luciferase	expression	level	be	obtain	for	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	implying	that	these	gene	be	true	<RNA_Name>	target	
<RNA_Name>	function	as	a	tumor	suppressor	by	target	k-ras	
however	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	do	not	affect	the	k-ras	mrna	expression	level	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	k-ras	mrna	translation	without	affect	accumulation	level	
these	result	demonstrate	that	k-ras	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	we	verify	this	with	the	luciferase	reporter	assay	
in	contrast	the	luciferase	activity	be	not	affect	by	mutant	type	mt-k-ras	plasmid	cotransfection	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	and	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	potentially	because	<RNA_Name>	be	unable	to	recognize	the	complete	mutant	bind	site	of	k-ras	mrna	thereby	disrupt	the	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	k-ras	
these	data	indicate	that	k-ras	be	target	directly	by	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	k-ras	be	a	functional	targetin	the	growth	retardation	induce	by	<RNA_Name>	
use	this	assay	we	find	that	the	3'utr	of	<RNA_Name>	can	confer	a	significant	mir-52-dependent	inhibition	of	translation	
we	then	test	whether	the	<RNA_Name>	family	can	regulate	the	<RNA_Name>	3'utr	in	the	hypodermis	in	which	the	<RNA_Name>	family	be	express	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	can	be	assay	easily	
take	together	these	data	show	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	the	<RNA_Name>	3'utr	in	vivo	
we	also	test	if	the	<RNA_Name>	3'utr	be	regulate	by	the	<RNA_Name>	family	in	the	arcade	cell	where	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	family	mirnas	may	be	require	for	pharyngeal	attachment	
these	data	suggest	that	the	<RNA_Name>	family	directly	regulate	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	the	arcade	cell	
these	data	suggest	that	at	least	one	function	of	the	<RNA_Name>	family	during	pharyngeal	morphogenesis	be	to	downregulate	<RNA_Name>	
the	<RNA_Name>	family	member	target	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
the	<RNA_Name>	family	be	divide	into	two	group	accord	to	their	sequence	seed	group	<Number>	and	group	<Number>	in	isolated	glomerulus	of	16-wk-old	lp	animal	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	significantly	down-regulated	compare	to	np	offspring	
the	<RNA_Name>	family	member	target	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	lp	offspring	the	gene	expression	for	collagen	1alpha1	collagen	1alpha2	and	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	be	significantly	increase	in	isolated	glomerulus	
surprisingly	unchanged	finding	for	mrna	expression	for	<Protein_Name>	e-cadherin	<Protein_Name>	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	zo-1	be	find	for	both	group	
luciferase	reporter	assay	and	expression	analysis	show	that	<Protein_Name>	a	tissue	<Protein_Name>	inhibitor	be	a	common	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	and	-181b	
these	data	suggest	a	cumulative	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	and	-181	on	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	the	ohtr	cell	in	summary	growth	factor	signaling	be	facilitate	in	ohtr	cell	due	to	reduce	<Protein_Name>	level	that	in	turn	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	and	-181b	in	these	cell	
these	data	suggest	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	181b	and	<Protein_Name>	in	facilitate	akt-mediated	proliferation	of	tamoxifen-resistant	cell	
western	blot	analysis	show	that	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	decrease	the	expression	level	of	endogenous	pim-1	protein	in	addition	there	be	no	significant	decrease	in	the	mrna	level	of	pim-1	on	<RNA_Name>	transfection	although	a	tendency	for	the	decreased	expression	of	pim-1	be	observe	in	spindle-shaped	smcs	
together	our	result	demonstrate	that	pim-1	be	a	direct	regulatory	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	smcs	
give	that	pim-1	be	know	to	stimulate	the	proliferation	of	smcs	our	result	provide	an	explanation	for	mir-1-mediated	<Protein_Name>	proliferation	repression	
microrna-132	target	hb-egf	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	
first	we	check	the	functionality	of	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	the	<Number>	'	-utr	of	human	<Protein_Name>	
for	this	experiment	the	luciferase	reporter	gene	be	<Protein_Name>	with	the	3'utr	sequence	of	human	<Protein_Name>	and	this	vector	be	co-transfected	with	pre-mir-132	or	negative	control	oligos	into	<Protein_Name>	cell	
next	we	examine	whether	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	at	the	protein	level	in	mouse	<Protein_Name>	cell	
thus	the	exogenous	delivery	and	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	clearly	prove	that	<RNA_Name>	control	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	activate	<Protein_Name>	cell	
bioinformatic	prediction	suggest	that	the	human	<Protein_Name>	mrna	3'-untranslated	region	contains	three	<RNA_Name>	target	site	which	be	not	conserve	across	mammal	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	expression	in	cancer	cell	line	via	two	of	the	three	site	induce	cell	cycle	arrest	and	cell	death	
because	<RNA_Name>	be	show	to	decrease	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	we	use	microarray	analysis	to	identify	additional	mrna	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
furthermore	<RNA_Name>	attenuated	activation	of	protein	kinase	b	and	extracellular	signal-regulated	kinase	<Number>	<Number>	two	critical	effector	of	<Protein_Name>	signal	in	different	cancer	cell	line	
these	data	establish	an	important	role	for	<RNA_Name>	in	control	mrna	expression	and	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	have	the	ability	to	coordinately	regulate	<Protein_Name>	signal	in	multiple	human	cancer	cell	type	
as	expect	we	observe	a	significantly	low	expression	of	direct	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	protein	target	in	<Protein_Name>	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	compare	to	cell	transfected	with	control	mimic	
<RNA_Name>	directly	target	various	region	of	the	3'utr	to	repress	the	endogenous	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	breast	cancer	
take	together	these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	whereas	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	only	
these	finding	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	hscs	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	hscs	activation	and	migration	maybe	through	directly	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	indirectly	disturb	f-actin	
we	identify	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	-222	
meanwhile	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	-222	in	hek293	cell	lead	to	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
together	these	data	demonstrate	that	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	-222	
it	be	note	that	during	the	preparation	of	the	manuscript	a	report	be	publish	that	show	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	support	our	observation	
together	these	observation	demonstrate	that	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	<RNA_Name>	-222	lead	to	radioresistance	in	summary	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	involve	in	the	regulation	of	radiosensitivity	by	target	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	pathway	
<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	up-regulated	by	the	<Protein_Name>	transcription	factor	and	then	stabilize	by	the	long	noncoding	rna	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	these	finding	suggest	a	model	in	which	p63-activated	<Protein_Name>	induces	<Protein_Name>	expression	with	<Protein_Name>	mrna	then	post-transcriptionally	stabilize	by	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	rna	interactome	analysis	sequence	identify	apeak	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'-untranslated	region	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	could	be	a	<Protein_Name>	stabilization	target	
<Protein_Name>	mrna	but	not	the	<Protein_Name>	control	differentiation	gene	be	significantly	less	stable	with	<Protein_Name>	depletion	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	promotes	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	through	stabilization	
<RNA_Name>	dependent	binding	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	to	hepatitis	c	virus	rna	be	associate	with	enhanced	rna	stability	and	translation	stimulation	
here	we	show	that	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	protein	bind	to	the	hcv	5'-utr	in	a	mir-122-dependent	manner	whereas	the	hcv	3'utr	do	not	bind	<Protein_Name>	
quantitative	reverse	transcription	pcr	and	western	blotting	analysis	reveal	that	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	increase	after	downexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	glioma	cell	
<RNA_Name>	can	target	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
both	in	the	glioma	cell	line	u251	and	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	can	enhance	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	to	further	suppress	activated-akt	signaling	and	reduce	the	ability	of	invasion	and	proliferation	in	glioma	cell	line	
the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	a	significant	decrease	in	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	construct	contain	the	wild-type	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
this	regulation	be	abolish	when	the	nucleotide	in	the	putative	binding	site	be	mutate	indicate	that	the	mir-506-mediated	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	depend	on	its	binding	to	a	specific	seed	region	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
therefore	<Protein_Name>	play	an	important	role	in	the	proliferation	and	metastasis	of	colon	cancer	cell	potentially	by	act	as	a	mediator	of	<RNA_Name>	function	
the	luciferase	reporter	assay	verify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
together	these	result	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	have	a	direct	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	mediate	through	3'utr	target	site	
our	data	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	novel	target	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	implicate	their	role	in	the	inhibition	of	wound	healing	and	pathology	of	vus	
our	study	identify	and	confirm	<Protein_Name>	as	a	novel	target	for	the	most	induced	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	epidermis	suggesting	that	exogenous	<Protein_Name>	would	not	improve	healing	of	chronic	vus	
in	pancreatic	-beta	cell	c-rel	and	<Protein_Name>	of	the	nf-	b	family	activate	the	<RNA_Name>	gene	promoter	and	increase	<RNA_Name>	rna	level	<RNA_Name>	in	turn	decrease	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	which	be	able	to	induce	cell	death	through	the	<Protein_Name>	family	of	apoptotic	protein	
we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	while	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	be	equal	in	both	cell	line	the	protein	expression	be	inversely	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	expression	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	can	bindto	the	predicted	binding	site	in	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	influence	post-transcriptional	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
western	blotting	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	in	both	cell	line	demonstrate	a	high	level	in	sra01	<Number>	cell	compare	to	hle-b3	in	agreement	with	the	much	low	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	sra01	<Number>	compare	to	hle-b3	cell	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	to	inhibit	its	protein	translation	in	human	lung	epithelial	cell	
the	luciferase	activity	in	these	cell	show	that	<RNA_Name>	target	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	to	inhibit	its	translation	
in	addition	we	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	induce	apoptosis	in	cancer	cell	by	mir-125b-mediated	mitochondrial	pathway	via	target	to	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	indicate	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	functional	downstream	targetfor	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	be	due	to	inhibition	of	translation	via	direct	binding	to	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
furthermore	we	transfected	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	with	luciferase	reporter	construct	to	hepg2	cell	in	which	<RNA_Name>	be	highly	express	to	study	the	knockdown	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	in	epithelial	cell	
the	inhibitor	significantly	release	the	repression	by	<RNA_Name>	on	the	luciferase	gene	with	the	3'-utrs	of	n-cadherin	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
we	also	find	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	cause	a	significant	increase	of	endogenous	n-cadherin	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	in	hepg2	cell	in	contrast	the	inhibitor	do	not	affect	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	which	do	not	have	a	predictable	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	its	3'utr	in	conclusion	<RNA_Name>	may	suppress	metastasis	of	liver	cancer	cell	by	target	several	gene	that	function	at	the	different	stage	of	hcc	progression	and	metastasis	
<RNA_Name>	be	locate	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	
the	increased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	also	observe	in	nsclc	particularly	in	lymph	node-positive	one	4b	and	be	negatively	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	level	in	nsclc	tissue	biopsies	4c	this	prompt	us	to	study	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	ectopic	<RNA_Name>	express	cell	reveal	a	significant	down-regulation	4d	ectopic	<RNA_Name>	repress	the	activity	of	<Protein_Name>	wild-type	3'utr	reporter	construct	in	dual	luciferase	reporter	assay	4f	while	mutation	in	mir-124-binding	site	completely	abrogate	this	repression	
therefore	it	be	demonstrate	that	the	<Protein_Name>	expression	could	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	via	conserved	seed-matching	sequence	and	correlate	with	the	node	metastasis	of	nsclc	disease

c	ebpalpha	directly	interact	with	the	<RNA_Name>	chromatin	and	bound	to	<RNA_Name>	putative	promoter	that	contain	a	c	ebpalpha-consensus	motif	in	addition	we	find	that	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	progressively	up-regulated	whereas	that	of	<RNA_Name>	and	its	activator	c	ebpalpha	be	down-regulated	in	a	breast	cancer	progression	model	consist	of	mcf-10a	cell	line	whose	phenotype	range	from	noninvasive	to	highly	invasive	
c	ebpalpha	expression	in	breast	cancer	cell	result	in	increased	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	reduced	<Protein_Name>	3'utr-luciferase	activity	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
we	believe	our	finding	show	for	the	first	time	that	c	ebpalpha	regulate	the	level	of	<RNA_Name>	and	in	turn	modifies	the	function	of	the	mir661-mta1	pathway	in	human	cancer	cell	
base	on	these	finding	we	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	be	far	investigate	for	therapeutic	use	in	down-regulating	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	cancer	cell	
we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	show	that	its	expression	be	upregulated	in	tumor	sample	and	inversely	correlate	with	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>

in	this	study	we	have	demonstrate	a	mechanism	that	<RNA_Name>	be	decrease	in	clinical	nsclc	tissue	compare	to	adjacent	normal	lung	tissue	and	that	<RNA_Name>	play	a	critical	role	in	nsclc	progression	by	regulate	cell	proliferation	and	invasion	via	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	
2c	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	restoration	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	malignant	cell	
this	suggest	that	the	observed	disease-associated	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	may	be	responsible	for	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	subsequent	loss	of	<Protein_Name>	phenotype	in	malignant	t	cell	
we	test	whether	<RNA_Name>	also	regulate	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	level	within	cell	at	the	posttranscriptional	level

the	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	-101	reduce	considerably	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	suggest	that	both	mirnas	act	as	translational	repressor	
we	also	notice	that	<RNA_Name>	and	-144	consensus	element	be	evolutionary	conserved	and	partially	overlap	within	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	suggest	that	the	mechanism	of	<Protein_Name>	regulation	by	<RNA_Name>	and	-101	be	conserve	in	primate	
take	together	our	result	suggest	that	mirnas	and	<RNA_Name>	in	particular	be	an	important	component	of	<Protein_Name>	regulatory	pathway	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	regulation	of	ataxin	<Number>	expression	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	conclusion	these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	have	the	ability	to	bind	directly	to	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	suppress	the	translation	of	<Protein_Name>

<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	mir-	135b	in	u87mg	glioblastoma	cell	
in	addition	we	demonstrate	that	decreased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	the	aml	cell	line	be	a	consequence	of	increased	level	of	<RNA_Name>	and	can	therefore	be	reverse	in	vitro	through	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	with	subsequent	inhibition	of	cell	proliferation	and	promotion	of	cell	apoptosis	
in	conclusion	expression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	in	aml	
<RNA_Name>	act	as	an	onco-mir	and	the	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	could	play	an	important	role	in	the	pathogenesis	of	aml	
the	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	significantly	downregulated	while	<RNA_Name>	be	upregulated	in	h460	and	spc-a1	cell	
since	we	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	and	mediate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	nsclc	we	speculate	that	<Protein_Name>	could	have	functional	mechanism	in	regulate	nsclc

these	data	support	the	idea	that	<RNA_Name>	be	involve	in	translational	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
this	show	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	can	decrease	the	<Protein_Name>	level	sufficiently	to	reduce	expression	from	a	smad4-dependent	luciferase	reporter	plasmid	
together	these	result	show	that	the	reduced	<Protein_Name>	level	in	cell	with	high	<RNA_Name>	expression	lower	the	sensitivity	to	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	stimulation	and	allow	the	cell	to	continue	their	proliferation	at	a	high	rate	without	induce	apoptosis	or	granulocytic	maturation

<RNA_Name>	directly	repress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	through	their	3'-utrs	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	repress	the	mrna	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	at	posttranscriptional	level	by	directly	target	their	3'-utrs	
all	these	result	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	the	genuine	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	interact	with	the	3'utr	of	the	gene	in	mcf-7	cell	
at	least	<Number>	of	the	tumor	sample	show	a	great	than	two-fold	increase	in	the	expression	for	<RNA_Name>	and	for	the	<RNA_Name>	cluster	when	compare	with	the	corresponding	paired	non-tumor	sample	
knock-down	study	for	the	<RNA_Name>	cluster	which	include	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	show	that	the	expression	of	the	cluster	be	necessary	for	cell	proliferation	and	for	anchorage-independent	growth	
we	far	identify	the	transcription	factor	<Protein_Name>	as	a	target	gene	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	it	be	likely	that	one	of	the	role	of	the	<RNA_Name>	cluster	be	to	prevent	excessively	high	<Protein_Name>	expression	which	may	then	cause	apoptosis	
we	conclude	that	there	be	aberrant	expression	of	micrornas	encode	by	the	oncogenic	<RNA_Name>	cluster	and	the	<RNA_Name>	cluster	in	hepatocellular	carcinoma	
we	perform	a	qpcr	analysis	of	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	isoform	<Number>	and	<Protein_Name>	isoform	<Number>	in	<Number>	pair	of	hcc	tumor	and	match	adjacent	non-tumor	tissue

furthermore	<RNA_Name>	significantly	regulate	cell	invasion	by	target	<Protein_Name>	but	have	noeffecton	cell	proliferation	and	apoptosis	
furthermore	we	identify	that	<RNA_Name>	could	regulate	hcc	cell	invasion	via	target	<Protein_Name>	in	sum	these	result	imply	that	<RNA_Name>	could	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	bind	its	3'utr	
to	well	understand	the	mechanism	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	cell	invasion	we	identify	<RNA_Name>	regulating	<Protein_Name>	in	hcc	use	luciferase	reporter	and	western	blot	assay	
in	this	study	we	not	only	show	that	<Protein_Name>	as	an	oncogene	be	upregulated	and	could	promote	proliferation	of	sgc-7901	cell	but	also	demonstrate	that	its	over	expression	lead	to	a	strong	decrease	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	in	turn	directly	downregulated	by	<RNA_Name>	thereby	establish	a	negative	feedback	loop	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
the	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	indeed	downregulated	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	in	sgc-7901	cell	
all	the	result	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	protein-coding	gene	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	its	3'utr	
in	the	present	study	we	find	that	a	microrna	<RNA_Name>	have	a	binding	site	in	3'-untranslated	region	of	the	vegf-a	mrna	
<RNA_Name>	interacts	with	vegf-a	3'utr	in	order	to	test	whether	<RNA_Name>	be	indeed	capable	of	regulate	vegf-a	protein	expression	via	the	bind	site	in	vegf-a	3'utr	we	clone	the	predicted	<RNA_Name>	bind	site	from	cdna	library	downstream	the	firefly	luciferase	cod	region	in	pmir-reporttm	luciferase	vector	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	inhibit	vegf-a	expression	
in	addition	to	validate	whether	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	we	mutate	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	observed	loss	of	repression	
these	result	all	indicate	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	hepatocytes	and	the	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	regenerating	liver	tissue	may	lead	to	the	increase	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
the	result	indicate	that	the	fragment	at	the	3'-utrs	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	the	complementary	site	for	the	<RNA_Name>	seed	region	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
overall	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	
the	expression	level	of	<RNA_Name>	indicate	by	real-time	pcr	be	significantly	reduce	while	that	of	hif-2alpha	be	increase	in	the	sw620	colon	cancer	cell	
to	monitor	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	on	hif-2alpha	expression	in	target	cell	express	low	level	of	<RNA_Name>	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	and	scramble	control	be	deliver	into	sw620	cell	
to	test	whether	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	regulation	we	clone	the	3-	utrs	of	each	gene	into	a	reporter	plasmid	and	perform	dual	luciferase	assay	in	nih3t3	cell	while	over-expressing	<RNA_Name>	
when	<RNA_Name>	be	overexpressed	the	reporter	contain	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	3-	utrs	be	significantly	down-regulated	relative	to	the	empty	reporter	
we	focus	on	<RNA_Name>	that	exert	significant	growth	inhibition	and	induced	cell	death	upon	transfection	with	a	<RNA_Name>	precursor	in	bladder	carcinoma	cell	line	t24	and	sw780	cell	
use	luciferase	assay	we	document	a	direct	link	between	<RNA_Name>	and	the	two	putative	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	lead	to	an	increase	in	acetylated	<Protein_Name>	and	its	transcriptional	target	
these	result	suggest	that	the	3'utr	of	human	<Protein_Name>	repress	the	activity	in	association	with	the	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	level	in	human	liver	be	significantly	in	spearman	rank	correlate	with	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	and	protein	level	as	well	as	show	significant	linear	regression	with	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	and	protein	level	
<RNA_Name>	downregulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	to	suppress	proliferation	and	promote	apoptosis	of	triple-negative	breast	cancer	cell	
more	interestingly	<RNA_Name>	be	find	to	be	down-regulated	only	in	bl	case	that	be	negative	for	<Protein_Name>	translocation	suggest	that	this	event	might	be	responsible	for	c-myc	deregulation	in	such	case	
this	hypothesis	be	far	confirm	by	our	in	vitro	experiment	which	demonstrate	that	increase	dos	of	synthetic	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	modulate	c-myc	expression

thus	bc032469	may	function	as	a	cerna	to	impair	mir-1207-5p-dependent	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	suggest	that	it	may	be	clinically	valuable	as	a	poor	prognostic	biomarker	of	gastric	cancer	
our	previous	study	have	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	could	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	by	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
we	hypothesize	that	lncrna	bc032469	might	have	the	same	interaction	with	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	to	regulate	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
the	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulated	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	its	3'utr	in	pancreatic	cancer	and	that	<Protein_Name>	be	downregulated	in	pancreatic	cancer	cell	due	to	the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	result	show	that	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	significantly	downregulated	in	the	cell	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	
to	more	directly	test	if	socs-1	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	we	measure	socs-1	mrna	in	wild	type	andmir155-	-	<Protein_Name>	t	cell	as	well	as	in	cell	overexpressing	<RNA_Name>	or	scramble	control	<Protein_Name>

these	result	show	that	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	impairs	two	cellular	process	control	by	<Protein_Name>	
in	concordance	with	our	in	silico	data	we	find	that	the	agomir	to	<RNA_Name>	repressed	<Protein_Name>	expression	whereas	the	antagomir	increase	its	expression	
this	suggest	that	the	in	vivo	anabolicaction	of	<RNA_Name>	be	also	mediate	through	<Protein_Name>	repression	and	<Protein_Name>	activation	
we	likewise	propose	a	pathway	in	which	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	to	enhance	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	osteoblast	differentiation	
use	the	target	prediction	analysis	we	find	that	a	conserved	sequence	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	have	a	perfect	match	to	the	seed	sequence	of	<RNA_Name>

these	study	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	their	murineorthologs	have	coincident	cellular	expression	pattern	in	the	endometrium	
conversely	inhibit	<RNA_Name>	by	antagomir-92a	treatment	in	mouse	increase	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	in	the	vasculature	of	skeletal	muscle	tissue

these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	with	the	specific	binding	site	
mechanistic	investigation	define	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	and	functional	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	which	be	involve	in	the	<RNA_Name>	knockdown	induced	regulation	of	the	integrity	and	permeability	of	<Protein_Name>	as	well	as	the	expression	of	zo-1	<Protein_Name>	and	claudin-5	
thus	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	igf-1	expression	in	ewing	sarcoma	
as	show	in	figure	3f	compare	with	negative	control	<RNA_Name>	robustly	inhibit	reporter	expression	through	its	predict	site	in	the	igf-1r	3'utr	but	have	no	effect	when	the	<Protein_Name>	seed	sequence	be	mutate	
similarly	<RNA_Name>	specifically	inhibited	reporter	activity	through	its	predict	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
surprisingly	we	be	unable	to	demonstrate	direct	regulation	of	the	igf-1	3'utr	by	<RNA_Name>	suggesting	that	the	regulation	of	igf-1	protein	level	occur	via	other	mechanism	
<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	targetpten	and	<Protein_Name>	3'utrs

moreover	we	find	as	assess	by	western	blot	an	inverse	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	rna	expression	and	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	in	most	cell	line	analyze	confirm	also	by	qrt-pcr	
these	data	far	support	the	finding	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	also	in	vivo	
interestingly	we	observe	a	significant	increase	on	the	migratory	and	invasive	capability	of	h460	and	sk-hep1	cell	after	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	overexpression	as	well	after	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	
previous	result	show	that	also	in	our	model	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
real	time	pcr	analysis	demonstrate	that	the	addition	of	curcumin	to	<Protein_Name>	cell	for	<Number>	hour	cause	a	dose-dependent	increase	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
our	data	indicate	that	the	curcumin	treatment	induce	an	exosomes-mediated	decrease	of	<RNA_Name>	that	in	turn	cause	the	modulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	confirm	by	the	study	of	gain	and	loss	of	function	for	<RNA_Name>	
thus	<RNA_Name>	could	target	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	negatively	regulate	its	expression	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	attenuate	migration	and	invasion	of	glioma	cell	and	u251	cell	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	show	significantly	low	endogenous	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	than	those	transfected	with	nonspecific	control	mirna	or	mock	in	summary	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	markedly	decrease	in	human	glioma	cell	line	and	for	the	first	time	describe	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	cellular	proliferation	migration	and	invasion	ability	of	high-invasive	glioma	cell	and	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	may	be	one	of	putative	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>

our	experiment	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	critically	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	but	not	by	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	produce	some	<Number>	abrogation	of	the	luciferase	activity	report	by	the	vector	carry	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Number>	reduction	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	unaffected	by	<RNA_Name>	
as	the	bind	site	of	<Protein_Name>	be	conserve	between	human	and	mouse	specie	we	seek	to	validate	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	through	a	luciferase	reporter	assay	that	could	verify	the	direct	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	reduced	luciferase	activity	from	the	reporter	vector	contain	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
moreover	mutation	of	the	putative	binding	site	on	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	abrogate	this	repression	support	the	direct	interaction	of	<RNA_Name>	with	<Protein_Name>	
this	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	directly	regulate	the	expression	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	
this	result	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	mediate	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	promote	cell	proliferation	and	cell	cycle	progression	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	known	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hepatocellular	cancer	cell	<Number>	we	observe	that	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	significantly	down-	egulated	<Protein_Name>	expression	whereas	knock-	own	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	up-	egulated	the	<Protein_Name>	level	
data	from	the	dual	luciferase	assay	show	that	<RNA_Name>	decrease	the	luciferase	activity	of	wild-	ype	pmir-	pp2r2a-3'utr	but	not	that	of	the	mutated	pmir-	pp2r2a-3'utr	
hese	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	bladder	cancer	cell	in	a	manner	associate	with	mir-222-	nduced	proliferation	
therefore	we	hypothesize	that	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	might	play	a	role	in	mediate	tlr4-mediated	secondary	inflammatory	damage	after	ir	by	up-regulating	the	ticam-2	transcript	
these	result	be	consistent	with	the	hypothesis	that	the	ir-mediated	reduction	in	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	ticam-2	expression	which	in	turn	influence	<Protein_Name>	signal	and	the	activation	of	downstream	inflammatory	cytokine	
in	contrast	<RNA_Name>	pair	to	<Protein_Name>	mrna	promotes	change	in	rna	structure	that	displace	<Protein_Name>	thereby	allow	efficient	translation	as	well	as	mrna	stabilization	
meantime	luciferase	reporter	assay	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	eoc	cell

we	also	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
western	blot	analysis	demonstrate	that	treatment	with	the	lentiviral	antigomir-494	vector	result	in	increased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	decreased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	c	
examination	of	the	sequence	of	the	<Protein_Name>	primase	3'utr	with	several	mirna	target	prediction	program	suggest	two	likely	target	for	<RNA_Name>	in	exon	<Number>	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	and	one	in	exon	<Number>	of	the	gene	
the	sequence	of	these	target	site	and	their	predicted	basepairing	with	<RNA_Name>	be	show	in	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	downregulate	<Protein_Name>	mrna	during	pituitary	development	
here	we	show	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	able	to	antagonize	cytoplasmic	mirnas	and	result	in	the	increased	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	downstream	targetmrna	<Protein_Name>	
computational	algorithm	have	predict	three	mirnas	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	can	bindto	both	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	3'-utrs	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	b	could	target	3'utr	of	igf-1	by	complementary	base-pairing	to	its	target	site	as	predicted	
these	result	far	support	the	idea	that	igf-1	be	a	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	during	hrecs	proliferation	
transfection	of	intestinal	cell	with	a	<RNA_Name>	mimic	or	inhibitor	confirm	its	negative	regulatory	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	ubiquitination	of	i	balpha	
conversely	the	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	significantly	up-regulated	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	be	a	direct	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	at	both	the	transcriptional	and	translational	level	
we	further	determine	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	negative	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	through	direct	interaction	with	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	to	inhibit	its	translation	
we	identify	nmda	receptor	subunit	<Protein_Name>	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	show	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	specifically	associate	with	<Protein_Name>	in	brain	
together	these	data	indicate	that	neuronal	<RNA_Name>	can	specifically	regulate	<Protein_Name>	reporter	expression	
these	data	extend	the	finding	use	ff-luc	reporter	and	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	regulate	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	in	neuron	
together	these	data	indicate	that	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	directly	and	specifically	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	affect	nmda	receptor	function	accordingly	
together	these	data	indicate	that	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	normally	suppress	by	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	well	as	by	<RNA_Name>	and	these	mechanism	show	partial	functional	interaction	
here	we	report	that	cellular	mrna	encode	the	cellular	cyclin-dependent	kinase	inhibitor	<Protein_Name>	a	key	inducer	of	cell	cycle	arrest	be	direct	target	for	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>

<Protein_Name>	be	a	candidate	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
three	bind	site	of	<RNA_Name>	be	find	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	observation	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	bindainly	to	the	first	target	site	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	3'utr	and	represses	gene	expression	
these	data	highlight	the	prediction	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>

this	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	promotes	mgc803	cell	growth	by	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	
the	human	tr-beta1	mrna	be	predict	to	have	other	bind	site	for	<RNA_Name>	and	the	luciferase	activity	of	a	human	tr-beta1	3'utr	reporter	be	decrease	significantly	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	finding	suggest	that	the	binding	site	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	3'utr	of	tr-beta1	could	mediate	translational	repression	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	finding	indicate	that	tr-beta1	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	both	in	rat	and	human	cell	
because	<RNA_Name>	could	upregulate	the	-beta-mhc	gene	under	serum-containing	condition	these	result	indicate	that	the	upregulation	of	-beta-mhc	by	<RNA_Name>	result	mainly	from	the	downregulation	of	tr-beta1	rather	than	<Protein_Name>

finally	we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	the	functional	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	oscc

in	the	mechanistic	study	we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	pancreatic	cancer	cell	and	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	inversely	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	pancreatic	cancer	patient

these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	major	molecule	target	by	<RNA_Name>	but	additional	mechanism	be	also	involved	
take	together	our	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	recognize	and	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	the	c-jun	mrna	transcript	to	inhibit	its	expression	
we	confirm	that	predict	<RNA_Name>	and	-181d	target	site	in	htra1-3'utr	be	critical	for	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	introduce	point	mutation	that	disrupt	the	base-pairing	of	both	predict	target	sit	into	rluc-htra1-3'utr	construct

indeed	we	demonstrate	that	the	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	liver	which	would	explain	why	the	mouse	with	hepatic	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	exhibit	all	of	the	hallmark	of	impaired	hepatic	insulin	signal	
<RNA_Name>	could	no	longer	decrease	the	luciferase	activity	of	only	the	psicheck	155mut1	2-transfected	cell	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	interfere	with	luciferase	expression	via	direct	interaction	with	both	<RNA_Name>	recognition	site	harbor	within	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
collectively	these	result	strongly	support	the	hypothesis	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	target	of	both	<RNA_Name>	and	-802	and	suggest	that	these	mirnas	markedly	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	<Protein_Name>	mrna	for	degradation	
take	together	these	result	far	support	the	premise	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	targetfor	<RNA_Name>	and	-802	and	underexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	may	be	involve	in	part	in	mediate	d	as	<RNA_Name>	and	-802	be	overexpressed	in	the	ts65dn	and	human	d	brain	specimens	we	hypothesize	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	would	be	underexpressed	and	<Protein_Name>	would	be	overexpressed	in	these	mouse	similar	to	what	be	observe	in	human	brain	sample	
we	far	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	bcl-2	mcl-1	and	x-linked	inhibitor	of	apoptosis	protein	by	direct	binding	to	3'utr	
<RNA_Name>	act	directly	at	the	bcl-2	mcl-1	xiap-3'utr	
thus	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	inhibit	the	expression	of	bcl-2	mcl-1	and	<Protein_Name>	by	bind	to	the	target	sequence	
furthermore	in	mcf7	cell	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	markedly	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	inhibition	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	expression	increase	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	cellular	apoptotic	activity	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	bound	to	the	sequence	present	in	the	3'utr	of	rat	<Protein_Name>	in	order	to	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	in	the	liver	of	shrsp	be	partially	reduce	by	an	increase	in	<RNA_Name>	level	
overexpression	experiment	show	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	its	in	silico-predicted	growth-related	target	include	<Protein_Name>	gtpase-activating	protein	cyclin-dependent	kinase	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	homolog	enrich	in	brain	in	addition	to	protein	synthesis	and	cell	size	
we	search	several	database	to	seek	the	possible	downstream	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	include	miranda	and	targetscan	in	order	to	confirm	the	direct	targeting	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	gene	we	carry	out	a	dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	
it	show	that	<RNA_Name>	significantly	decrease	the	luciferase	activity	of	wild	type	<Protein_Name>	
the	result	of	western	blot	show	that	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	also	suppress	<Protein_Name>	protein	production	in	hepg2	and	snu-182	cell	
the	expression	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	be	find	to	be	upregulated	by	<RNA_Name>	and	sirna-induced	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	result	in	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	homolog	delete	on	chromosome	<Number>	upregulation	and	reversal	of	the	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	upregulation	on	hcc	proliferation	
<Protein_Name>	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	
we	also	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	involve	in	the	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	on	hcc	development	possibly	through	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	
<RNA_Name>	alters	lung	cancer	cell	phenotype	by	inhibit	adhesion	migration	and	invasion	and	the	effect	on	invasion	may	be	partially	mediate	through	<Protein_Name>	regulation	
herein	we	identify	that	<Protein_Name>	may	be	a	functional	targetfor	<RNA_Name>	in	nsclc	
we	do	not	observe	a	direct	inverse	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	most	cell	line	or	tissue	
<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	targetfor	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	markedly	upregulated	by	treatment	with	<Protein_Name>	and	dznep	respectively	
<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	bmi-1	and	<Protein_Name>	which	be	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	suppress	by	treatment	with	<Protein_Name>	and	dznep	lead	to	apoptosis	cell	cycle	arrest	and	reduced	migration	of	<Protein_Name>	and	hepg2	cell	
the	3'utr	sequence	of	bothraldh2	and	<Protein_Name>	contain	9-	and	7-mer	site	respectively	that	be	complementary	to	5-	nucleotide	of	<RNA_Name>	
when	assay	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	<RNA_Name>	repress	the	luciferase	activity	of	reporter	contain	these	utr	sequence	
these	finding	establish	the	tumor	suppressive	role	of	<RNA_Name>	which	be	probably	through	direct	targeting	of	oncogene	such	as	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
through	luciferase	reporter	assay	western	blot	and	immunofluorescent	staining	we	identify	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	line	
take	together	our	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	suppress	the	migration	and	invasion	of	breast	cancer	cell	by	target	wnt-1	and	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	-beta-catenin	signal	pathway	and	this	will	provide	new	insight	into	the	molecular	mechanism	of	breast	cancer	metastasis	
use	both	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	analysis	we	identify	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	target	of	<RNA_Name>	b	
we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	its	coreceptor	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	signaling	and	that	antagonism	of	<RNA_Name>	b	in	aged	mouse	improve	blood	flow	recovery	after	ischemia	and	reduces	repression	of	these	target	
give	that	loss	of	the	cluster	increase	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	and	that	<RNA_Name>	reduce	luciferase	activity	of	the	3'utr	construct	in	a	sequence-specific	manner	but	do	not	directly	reduce	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	it	be	likely	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	translational	efficiency	of	<Protein_Name>	
thus	suppression	of	mir-	<Protein_Name>	b	activity	regulate	arteriogenesis	and	blood	flow	recovery	in	part	through	enhance	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	level	
decrease	<RNA_Name>	expression	correlate	with	increased	<Protein_Name>	protein	but	no	change	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	preconditioned	mousecortex	
these	study	validate	that	<RNA_Name>	an	mirna	know	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	be	decrease	in	preconditioned	mousecortex	
to	our	knowledge	our	study	be	the	first	to	show	that	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	that	<Protein_Name>	have	role	in	proliferation	of	pediatric	cancer	cell	such	as	daoy	medulloblastoma	cell	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	be	one	of	the	<Number>	mirnas	that	substantially	downregulated	<Protein_Name>	
when	we	mutate	the	binding	site	within	the	3'utr	corresponding	to	seed	region	for	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	the	mutated	3'utr	become	resistant	to	the	corresponding	mirna	demonstrate	that	these	mirnas	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	by	bind	to	a	seed	region	within	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	this	study	we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	that	<Protein_Name>	be	upregulated	in	multiple	pediatric	cancer	cell	line	include	rhabdomyosarcoma	neuroblastoma	and	medulloblastoma	cell	line	
here	we	show	that	microrna-124	a	small	non-coding	rna	down-regulated	in	oscc	be	able	to	downregulate	expression	of	integrin	beta-1	by	interact	with	its	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	
have	establish	that	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	directly	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	we	next	seek	to	identify	the	site	of	interaction	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	downregulates	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	mrna	expression	in	oscc	in	culture	
over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	h357	significantly	inhibit	adhesion	to	<Protein_Name>	and	reduce	<Protein_Name>	expression	suggest	this	be	a	result	of	mir-124-mediated	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	conclusion	we	have	demonstrate	for	the	first	time	the	ability	of	<RNA_Name>	to	suppress	oscc	invasion	and	migration	by	downregulating	<Protein_Name>	expression	
moreover	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	suppress	cisplatin-induced	apoptosis	and	lead	to	an	increase	resistance	to	cisplatin	
our	study	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	have	a	significantly	promote	effect	on	chemoresistance	of	c13	cell	and	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	contributes	to	cisplatin	resistance	through	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
however	no	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	the	activity	of	the	reporter	with	the	mutant	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	detect	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	targetgene	for	<RNA_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	and	overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	can	partially	reverse	the	<RNA_Name>	invasive	phenotype	
mirna-135a	promotes	breast	cancer	cell	migration	and	invasion	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
our	result	also	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	post-transcriptional	down-regulation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	targetgene	be	not	restrict	to	translation	repression	but	also	occur	by	induce	mrna	degradation	4c	which	agree	with	previous	report	on	the	action	of	mirnas	and	highly	homologous	target	
we	find	that	erk-dependent	latent	viral	gene	expression	the	induction	of	promigratory	factor	and	cell	invasiveness	followingde	novoinfection	of	primary	human	endothelial	cell	be	in	part	dependent	on	<RNA_Name>	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	duringde	novoinfection	kshv-encoded	
<RNA_Name>	upregulates	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	exist	data	indicate	a	role	for	<Protein_Name>	in	the	regulation	of	14-3-3	a	transcriptional	repressor	of	<Protein_Name>	
for	evaluate	the	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	both	specie	we	screen	the	3'utr	of	porcine	as	well	as	human	<Protein_Name>	for	potential	<RNA_Name>	target	site	
this	experiment	prove	the	interaction	between	human	as	well	as	porcine	<Protein_Name>	target	site	and	<RNA_Name>	to	be	specific	
furthermore	it	show	that	<RNA_Name>	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	be	conserve	among	both	specie	
these	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	its	expression	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
the	repressive	activity	of	<RNA_Name>	on	its	target	<Protein_Name>	become	physiologically	relevant	if	it	be	able	to	sustain	the	expression	of	rig-i	that	be	negatively	modulate	by	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	putative	target	for	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	be	confirm	by	western	blot	for	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	as	well	as	the	know	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	an	effective	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	also	find	that	<Protein_Name>	could	reverse	the	apoptosis-inhibition	effect	induce	by	<RNA_Name>	
moreover	hbv	could	inhibit	cell	apoptosis	by	down-regulating	<Protein_Name>	expression	which	could	be	reverse	by	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	
our	data	demonstrate	that	hbv	suppress	apoptosis	of	hepatoma	cell	by	up-regulating	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	down-regulating	<Protein_Name>	expression	which	may	provide	a	new	understanding	of	the	mechanism	in	hbv-related	hcc	pathogenesis	
here	we	demonstrate	that	the	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	p2	domain	be	control	by	<RNA_Name>	microrna-mediated	silencing	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
thus	both	strand	of	<RNA_Name>	might	contribute	to	<Protein_Name>	silence	through	bind	to	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	targetsites	within	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	alone	be	critical	for	<RNA_Name>	mediated	silencing	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
together	these	result	provide	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	alone	be	sufficient	to	silence	<Protein_Name>	expression	
furthermore	<RNA_Name>	suppress	cell	apoptosis	by	inhibit	caspase	activity	and	by	regulate	the	balance	between	bcl-2	and	<Protein_Name>	level	
western	blot	analysis	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	caspase-3	and	caspase-9	protein	level	decrease	in	cell	that	overexpressed	<RNA_Name>	compare	with	control	
as	we	have	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	more	radio-resistant	than	cb	cell	the	observed	efficient	dna	repair	after	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	in	cb	cell	could	either	be	due	to	the	direct	effect	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	or	the	result	of	dedifferentiation	of	cb	into	<Protein_Name>	
figure	<Number>	the	potential	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	be	upregulated	in	macrophage	stimulate	with	lp	in	summary	base	on	our	previous	study	result	qrt-pcr	be	perform	to	validate	the	mrna	level	of	<Number>	inflammation-related	candidate	target	gene	include	<Protein_Name>	
we	for	the	first	time	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	experimental	validation	and	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	lps-induced	upregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	work	as	a	basilic	regulating	factor	to	alleviate	cell	death	in	the	process	of	ad	by	target	<Protein_Name>	play	an	essential	role	in	the	control	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	and	might	be	consider	as	a	novel	therapeutic	targetin	treat	ad	
this	finding	suggest	that	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	may	promote	the	production	of	endogenous	a	through	up-regulating	the	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	then	far	induce	similar	cytotoxic	effect	as	the	exogenous	a	insult	
we	have	predict	<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	<RNA_Name>	potential	targetgenes	
end-point	rt-pcr	reveal	the	expression	of	l-	and	s-has2-as1	splice	variant	that	differ	only	in	their	length	of	sequence	complementarity	with	<Protein_Name>	and	provide	evidence	of	<RNA_Name>	rna	<Protein_Name>	mrna	duplex	formation	
the	calculation	therefore	support	the	existence	of	a	dimer	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	<RNA_Name>	rna	in	the	absence	of	sequestration	of	the	rna	in	kinetic	or	thermodynamic	trap	which	be	not	consider	by	this	analysis	
8b	depict	the	detection	of	a	ribonuclease-	and	deoxyribonuclease-resistant	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	heteroduplex	in	<Protein_Name>	cytoplasmic	rna	
far	study	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	promoted	<Protein_Name>	migration	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	downstream	activation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	downregulated	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	our	result	indicate	a	role	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	the	regulation	of	hgf-induced	<Protein_Name>	migration	through	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	its	downstream	signaling	molecule	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
such	a	downregulation	be	occur	through	direct	interaction	of	the	<RNA_Name>	with	the	3'utr	region	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	lead	to	a	diminished	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	and	consequently	an	enhanced	<Protein_Name>	activation	and	expression	of	vascular	endothelial	growth	factor	an	akt-regulated	protein	
accordingly	it	be	very	likely	that	<Protein_Name>	-induced	<Protein_Name>	activation	be	achieve	through	the	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	a	sustain	<Protein_Name>	activation	and	an	increase	in	cell	growth	and	proliferation	result	in	cell	transformation	
in	contrast	the	mir-190in	do	not	show	inhibition	on	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	activity	
moreover	deletion	of	the	mir-190-binding	site	within	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	abrogate	the	repressive	ability	of	the	<RNA_Name>	on	the	reporter	gene	activity	demonstrate	specificity	of	the	targetsequence	for	<Protein_Name>	
thus	these	data	provide	strong	evidence	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	-induced	<RNA_Name>	be	crucial	for	the	downregulation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	
<RNA_Name>	reduce	tnf-alpha	induced	cardiomyocytes	apoptosis	
tnf-alpha	downregulated	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	upregulated	the	mrna	and	protein	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
phosphorylation	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	enhance	in	cardiomyocytes	transfected	with	lenti-microrna-21	
compare	with	cardiomyocytes	treat	with	tnf-alpha	the	phosphorylation	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	well	as	expression	of	ppten	paktser473	pfoxo3a	and	<Protein_Name>	be	significantly	suppress	in	cardiomyocytes	treat	with	lenti-microrna-21	and	tnf-alpha	
we	identify	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	potential	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	use	several	algorithm	which	be	confirm	by	3'utr	luciferase	assay	and	western	analysis	
this	result	suggest	that	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
in	addition	rna-immunoprecipitation	and	luciferase	reporter	assay	show	that	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
our	data	also	demonstrate	that	there	exist	a	competition	of	<RNA_Name>	between	igf1-3'utr	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	igf1-3'utr	promoted	angiogenesis	at	least	in	part	via	sponge	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	our	study	suggest	that	igf1-3'utr	function	as	a	cerna	in	promote	angiogenesis	by	sponge	<RNA_Name>	in	osteosarcoma	
because	igf-3'utr	share	regulatory	<RNA_Name>	with	<Protein_Name>	we	suspect	that	igf-3'utr	could	modulate	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	all	these	result	suggest	an	important	role	of	igf1-3'utr	in	modulate	<Protein_Name>	by	competitively	bind	<RNA_Name>	
qrt-pcr	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	whereas	as-mir-155	enhance	it	
far	study	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
the	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	suppress	renilla	luciferase	activity	in	a	dose-dependent	manner	and	that	the	mutation	in	the	seed	sequence	of	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	where	<RNA_Name>	be	predict	to	bind	bolished	the	suppression	of	renilla	luciferase	activity	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	function	through	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	respectively	in	pdcs	during	<Protein_Name>	stimulation	
thus	these	result	confirm	the	bioinformatics	prediction	that	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	
the	result	show	that	the	cell	treat	with	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	decrease	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	<Number>	compare	with	cell	treat	with	the	control	mimic

these	result	provide	evidence	that	the	<RNA_Name>	family	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	
furthermore	quantitative	rt-pcr	assay	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	do	not	change	in	mir-30-overexpressing	cell	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	family	member	regulate	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	on	the	basis	of	translational	repression	rather	than	mrna	degradation	
these	data	provide	strong	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	family	member	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	by	directly	bind	to	the	two	distinct	seed	site	within	its	3'utr	
these	result	suggest	that	the	early	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	immediately	after	bmp-2	treatment	may	facilitate	release	their	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	
all	of	these	data	provide	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	member	mediate	the	inhibition	of	osteogenesis	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
we	have	previously	show	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	icam-1	mrna	and	that	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hmec-1	cause	de-repression	of	icam-1	gene	expression	
as	expect	the	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	at	<Number>	h	after	treatment	be	follow	by	a	reciprocal	decrease	in	icam-1	expression	at	<Number>	h	
as	show	in	figure	<Number>	c	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	cause	a	<Number>	reduction	in	cell	surface-bound	icam-1	thus	confirm	our	previous	result	and	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	play	a	role	in	regulate	endothelial	icam-1	expression

both	pri-	and	mature	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	increase	in	s	zary	cell	when	compare	with	<Protein_Name>	t	cell	from	healthy	donor	
silencing	of	<RNA_Name>	in	s	zary	cell	result	in	increased	apoptosis	suggest	a	functional	role	for	<RNA_Name>	in	the	leukomogenic	process	
take	together	these	finding	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	downstream	target	for	<RNA_Name>	in	hct116	cell	
<Protein_Name>	be	confirm	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>

re-introduction	of	<Protein_Name>	in	cell	express	<RNA_Name>	distinctly	abrogate	mir-625-mediated	inhibition	of	cell	growth	
take	together	our	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	cell	proliferation	and	migration	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	suggest	<RNA_Name>	as	a	promising	prognostic	biomarker	and	a	potential	therapeutic	target	for	breast	cancer	
these	result	demonstrate	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	suppress	its	expression	in	breast	cancer	
collectively	our	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	cell	proliferation	and	migration	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
to	address	this	issue	we	insert	microrna	response	element	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	which	be	all	underexpressed	in	lung	cancer	cell	into	an	adenoviral	vector	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
<RNA_Name>	inhibits	viral	replication	via	the	direct	targeting	of	cyclin	t1	mrna	and	along	with	<RNA_Name>	mediates	the	targeting	of	cyclin	t1	mrna	to	the	<Protein_Name>	
this	finding	indicate	that	the	four	residue	mutate	within	the	cyclin	t1	3'utr	be	necessary	for	<RNA_Name>	binding	as	the	disruption	of	this	site	abrogate	the	mir-27b-mediated	inhibition	of	luciferase	expression	
we	firstly	confirm	that	ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	mimic	effectively	downregulated	<Protein_Name>	in	hs-5	cell	and	next	we	evaluate	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	
indeed	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	increase	at	both	mrna	and	protein	level	in	cell	transduce	with	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	in	all	co-culture	system	
the	respective	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	-106a	the	tumor	suppressor	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	rb	with	their	pivotal	role	in	cell	cycle	regulation	apoptosis	and	proliferation	be	find	to	be	downregulated	
<RNA_Name>	be	a	tumor-suppressor	mirna	that	function	within	the	<Protein_Name>	pathway	to	regulate	cell-cycle	progression	and	apoptosis	
functional	analysis	show	that	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	inhibited	growth	enhance	apoptosis	and	reduced	migration	and	invasion	in	bc	cell	by	target	the	protooncogene	bcl-6	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	may	be	a	potential	biomarker	for	predict	the	survival	of	bc	patient	and	might	be	a	molecular	target	for	treatment	of	human	<Protein_Name>	
in	addition	protein	level	of	the	propose	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	be	high	in	aso-treated	adipocytes	
in	this	study	we	validate	and	report	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	modulate	by	<Protein_Name>	have	essential	role	in	cell	cycle	arrest	gefitinib-induced	apoptosis	epithelial-to-mesenchymal	transition	migration	and	tumorigenesis	of	gefitinib-resistant	lung	cancer	cell	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	gene	respectively	
in	contrast	<RNA_Name>	have	be	report	to	induce	proliferation	and	chemo-	or	radioresistance	through	directly	target	sort	nexin1	and	sphingolipid	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	in	nsclc	
<RNA_Name>	expression	have	be	demonstrate	to	promote	tumor	growth	metastasis	and	chemo-	or	radioresistance	in	nsclc	cell	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	mrna	level	be	significantly	decrease	in	tumor	in	the	group	treat	with	cpnp-anti-mirna	injection	alone	and	combination	of	radiation	and	cpnp-anti-mirna	injection	
target	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	can	inhibit	tumor	growth	through	elevate	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	inhibit	pi3k-akt	signaling	
western	blot	analysis	reveal	that	the	level	of	tgf-betar2	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	be	decrease	in	<RNA_Name>	overexpressing	clone	<Number>	as	well	as	in	pooled	clone	as	compare	with	vector-transfected	control	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	the	putative	<RNA_Name>	binding	to	tgf-betar2-3'utr	be	responsible	for	mir-21-mediated	downregulation	of	luciferase	activity	
the	result	from	the	current	investigation	show	that	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	be	associate	with	induction	of	stemness	through	downregulation	of	tgf-betar2	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	augmentation	of	-beta-catenin	<Protein_Name>	lef	signal	pathway	
the	identification	of	<Protein_Name>	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	us	to	assess	the	potential	influence	of	akt-inhibition	on	alternative	activation	by	use	a	specific	<Protein_Name>	inhibitor	triciribine30	
most	likely	this	reflect	the	fact	that	<RNA_Name>	will	target	other	as	yet-undefined	target	gene	besides	<Protein_Name>	and	thus	have	a	much	broad	effect	on	the	cellular	phenotype	than	discuss	here	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	decreased	luciferase	activity	in	<Protein_Name>	293a	cell	by	<Number>	
we	do	not	observe	any	significant	difference	in	luciferase	activity	follow	the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	regulate	<Protein_Name>	in	ewing	's	sarcoma	via	modulation	of	microrna-708	result	in	increase	cell	survival	and	chemoresistance	
we	further	show	that	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	mediate	upregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	via	repression	of	<RNA_Name>	a	mirna	that	target	the	<Protein_Name>	3'-untranslated	region	rather	than	by	bind	the	<Protein_Name>	promoter	directly	
together	these	data	suggest	that	the	major	mechanism	by	which	<Protein_Name>	be	overexpressed	in	ewing	sarcoma	be	via	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	repression	of	<RNA_Name>	which	target	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
the	molecular	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	be	down-regulated	by	ketamine	in	hippocampus	
<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
besides	we	have	knockdown	<RNA_Name>	in	siha	cell	which	have	the	high	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	expression	
by	use	functional	assay	<RNA_Name>	be	demonstrate	to	bindto	the	3'utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
western	blot	analysis	use	specific	antibody	against	<Protein_Name>	show	that	the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	decrease	by	<Number>	and	<Number>	in	the	pre-mir-34a-transfected	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	cell	respectively	
the	control	cotransfection	of	ets-1	3'utr	with	a	non-targeting	sequence	as	well	as	of	ets-1-mutated	3'utr	with	<RNA_Name>	-222	do	not	show	any	repression	in	luciferase	activity	confirm	the	specificity	of	such	interaction	
ets-1	downregulation	be	confirm	at	both	mrna	and	protein	level	in	mir-222-transduced	me1007	and	me1402	r	primary	melanoma	cell	line	in	agreement	with	the	luciferase	result	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	do	not	show	significant	effect	on	ets-1	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	true	regulator	of	ets-1	expression	
surprisingly	the	effect	induce	by	cotransfection	of	<RNA_Name>	be	negligible	suggesting	that	the	coordinate	function	report	for	<RNA_Name>	-222	in	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	c-kit	and	other	target	gene	can	be	uncoupled	
as	expect	tm4-derived	metastasis	display	a	significant	increase	of	<RNA_Name>	and	a	correlated	decrease	of	<Protein_Name>	compare	with	control	
next	we	demonstrate	that	a	snp	locate	within	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	could	affect	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	bladder	cancer	mainly	by	differential	binding	activity	of	<RNA_Name>	and	snp-related	mrna	stability	
a	mirna-binding	snp	locate	within	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	associate	with	gene	expression	and	may	be	a	promising	prognostic	factor	for	bladder	cancer	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	both	the	post-transcription	and	mrna	level	
we	find	that	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	level	be	down-regulated	in	the	<RNA_Name>	transfected	group	compare	with	the	nc	group	
<RNA_Name>	bind	<Protein_Name>	with	high	affinity	and	specificity	and	the	apparent	binding	constant	of	complex	formation	between	the	rna	and	the	protein	be	compatible	with	its	presence	in	vivo	
we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	yejabef-encoded	<Protein_Name>	permease	at	the	mrna	level	
<RNA_Name>	do	n't	directly	<Protein_Name>	to	yejab	mrna	
we	also	establish	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	primary	targetfor	<RNA_Name>	and	that	increase	level	of	<RNA_Name>	follow	traumatic	stress	be	accompany	by	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
as	show	in	figure	figure2a2a	and	and2b	2b	the	<RNA_Name>	mimetic	decrease	mrna	level	for	<Protein_Name>	conversely	the	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	increase	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
similar	effect	be	observe	at	the	protein	level	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	polypeptide	be	decrease	by	the	<RNA_Name>	mimetic	whereas	the	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	increase	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
we	conclude	that	<Protein_Name>	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
figure	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	be	a	<RNA_Name>	target	in	summary	we	report	that	c-src	activation	follow	traumatic	stress	lead	to	a	robust	increase	in	level	of	<RNA_Name>	and	a	corresponding	decrease	in	expression	of	the	neuromodulator	<Protein_Name>	a	confirmed	targetfor	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	seed	region	and	several	individual	gene	include	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	cyclin	e2	and	<Protein_Name>	have	be	experimentally	validate	as	<RNA_Name>	target	by	western	blotting	
take	together	our	data	suggest	that	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	g1	cell	cycle	arrest	be	through	the	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	which	be	associate	with	other	target	of	<RNA_Name>	either	additively	or	synergistically	
here	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	the	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	result	in	translational	inhibition	and	transcript	degradation	in	this	study	we	demonstrate	that	the	microrna	<RNA_Name>	be	in	endothelial	cell	and	bind	to	the	<Protein_Name>	3'-untranslated	region	result	in	rapid	and	efficient	transcript	degradation	and	translational	inhibition	
take	together	these	data	provide	compel	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	and	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
moreover	it	be	down-regulated	in	the	cisplatin-resistant	gastric	cancer	cell	line	sgc7901	cisplatin	and	the	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	in	sgc7901	<Protein_Name>	cell	be	accompany	by	the	up-regulation	of	insulin-like	growth	factor	<Number>	receptor	insulin	receptor	substrate	<Number>	pathway-related	protein	i	e	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	serine	threonine-protein	kinase	<Protein_Name>	and	the	apoptosis	regulator	bcl-2	compare	with	the	parental	sgc7901	cell	
change	in	the	luciferase	activity	of	reporter	construct	harbor	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	the	above	protein	in	sgc7901	<Protein_Name>	cell	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
promoter-reporter	experiment	support	the	idea	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	thereby	inhibit	protein	production	
luciferase	assay	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	can	all	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	mimic	show	protective	effect	on	ogd-induced	injury	to	h9c2	cell	by	reduce	apoptosis	decrease	<Protein_Name>	and	ck	activity	rescue	the	ogd-induced	ca	and	down-regulating	elevated	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	camkiiepsilon	and	<Protein_Name>	
the	result	show	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	the	mir-204m-treated	group	be	low	than	the	nc	and	<RNA_Name>	treated	group	
as	confirm	by	the	luciferase	activity	assay	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
far	study	show	that	<RNA_Name>	be	involve	in	<Protein_Name>	b	treatment	and	targeted	<Protein_Name>	as	confirm	by	luciferase	activity	assay	
<RNA_Name>	promotes	apoptosis	of	podocytes	under	high-glucose	condition	via	enhanced	caspase	cascade	for	<Protein_Name>	insufficiency	
<RNA_Name>	be	up-regulated	in	chemoresistant	osteosarcoma	and	promote	osteosarcoma	cell	resistance	to	cisplatin	by	down-regulating	twist	
furthermore	<Number>	nutriregulated	mirna	be	find	to	potentially	target	deg	in	which	three	predict	mirna	chr3	3319-5p	chr9	13534-5p	and	chr12	18027-5p	of	the	<Number>	nutriregulated	mirna	that	could	target	deg	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	mir-204-5pmay	target	seven	five	and	four	deg	respectively	
notably	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	nutriregulated	mirna	with	the	high	fold	change	in	high	throughput	sequence	in	addition	<RNA_Name>	may	target	five	deg	three	of	which	encode	for	zinc	finger	proteins	that	bind	dna	suggest	that	this	mirna	may	indirectly	regulate	gene	transcription	
consequently	the	deregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	by	food	deprivation	may	have	a	significant	impact	in	the	mammary	gland	through	the	regulation	of	deg	
luciferase	and	western	blot	assay	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	inhibits	human	cancer	phenotype	by	target	<Protein_Name>	p450	epoxygenase	2j2	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	inhibit	the	expression	and	tumor-promoting	function	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	the	enhance	effect	of	<Protein_Name>	on	tumor	formation	could	be	attenuate	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	show	that	human	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	downregulated	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
identification	of	tnf-alpha	and	il-12p40	as	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
therefore	this	assay	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
in	the	current	study	we	have	validate	that	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	bona	fide	<RNA_Name>	target	in	order	to	validate	<Protein_Name>	as	a	true	<RNA_Name>	target	we	use	reporter	assay	to	validate	the	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	interaction	at	the	two	targetsites	
these	data	provide	further	validation	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	<RNA_Name>	target	
<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	in	ovarian	cancer	cell	
these	data	verify	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	bound	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	to	suppress	its	expression	and	consequently	inhibit	the	emt	process	
in	our	study	we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	as	well	
to	confirm	the	direct	binding	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	we	construct	3'utr	sequence	of	<Protein_Name>	and	insert	into	luciferase	reporter	vector	
take	together	our	finding	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	play	a	critical	role	in	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
to	prove	functional	relevance	of	<Protein_Name>	regulation	by	<RNA_Name>	we	construct	a	<Protein_Name>	express	lentivirus	in	which	<Protein_Name>	cdna	do	not	contain	the	3'utr	sequence	that	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	
co-expression	of	this	<Protein_Name>	transgene	substantially	rescue	the	defect	in	colony	formation	of	breast	cancer	cell	infect	with	the	<RNA_Name>	lentivirus	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	the	key	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	at	least	with	respect	to	the	ability	of	<RNA_Name>	to	suppress	colony	formation	of	breast	cancer	cell	in	vitro	
<RNA_Name>	bind	to	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	in	lung	adenocarcinoma	cell	
as	a	result	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	reduce	the	expression	of	bcl-2	at	mrna	level	
compare	with	control	group	bcl-2	expression	be	remarkably	reduce	in	response	to	<RNA_Name>	transfection	for	48h	
take	together	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	decrease	expression	of	bcl-2	through	direct	3'utr	interaction	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	suppress	bcl-2	expression	by	target	the	3'utr	of	bcl-2	mrna	in	summary	this	study	far	extend	the	biological	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	nsclc	a549	cell	and	for	the	first	time	identifies	bcl-2	as	a	novel	targetpossibly	involve	in	mir-7-mediated	growth	suppression	and	apoptosis	induction	of	a549	cell	
further	comparison	of	formalin-fixed	paraffin-embedded	human	choriocarcinoma	mole	and	non-cancer	trophoblast	tissue	confirm	the	initial	finding	of	low	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	set	upregulation	in	choriocarcinomas	suggest	that	microrna-dysregulated	set	protein	may	account	for	the	rapid	growth	see	with	choriocarcinomas	
thus	our	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	might	be	involve	in	the	pathogenesis	of	<Protein_Name>	by	regulate	cytokine	profile	which	may	be	mediate	by	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	finding	indicate	that	hypoxia-responsive	microrna-377	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	and	knockdown	of	endogenous	microrna-377	promotes	msc-induced	angiogenesis	in	the	infarcted	myocardium	
furthermore	both	dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	and	western-blotting	verify	that	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	bind	with	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	lead	to	negatively	regulation	of	its	expression	
to	confirm	the	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	to	the	3'utr	region	of	hif-1alpha	we	generate	a	mutant	form	of	<RNA_Name>	harbor	correspond	mutation	to	the	mutant	hif-1alpha	3'utr	in	contrast	hif-1alpha	mrna	level	be	unchanged	in	all	cell	line	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	hif-1alpha	in	a	posttranscriptional	manner	
all	these	effect	could	be	reverse	by	coexpressing	a	dominant-negative	hif-1alpha	construct	emphasize	the	regulatory	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hif-1alpha-dependent	angiogenic	induction	
to	test	the	involvement	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hif-1alpha-dependent	angiogenesis	in	vivo	mouse	be	s	c	
we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulates	angiogenesis	both	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	through	the	inhibition	of	hif-1alpha

in	crl-7566	cell	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	mimic	similar	as	sidapk1	could	significantly	reduce	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	crl-11731	cell	transfection	of	antagomir-191	similar	as	infection	with	dapk1-mut	lentiviral	particle	could	significantly	increase	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	regulate	its	expression	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	modulates	response	of	ovarian	endometriosis	and	endometrioid	carcinoma	cell	to	tnf-alpha	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
we	find	that	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	with	214in	increase	whereas	enhance	<RNA_Name>	expression	with	214mi	decreased	n-ras	mrna	level	relative	to	that	in	the	control	cell	transfected	with	a	nonspecific	mirna	
collectively	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	hr-mediated	dna	damage	repair	and	radioresistance	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
a	computational	reexamination	of	the	<Protein_Name>	cod	sequence	reveal	a	second	potential	interaction	of	<Protein_Name>	with	<Protein_Name>	
base	pair	between	<Protein_Name>	and	the	two	region	of	<Protein_Name>	would	form	a	contiguous	coaxial	stack	loop	out	the	middle	part	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	in	mcf-7	and	<Protein_Name>	cell	line	down-regulates	the	expression	of	caprin-1	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	cyclin	e	at	the	protein	l	
when	only	plexin-b1-3'utr	or	plexin-b1-3utrmut	be	transfected	into	<Protein_Name>	cell	the	fiuorescence	intensity	of	plexin-b1-3'utr	be	significantly	decrease	because	of	the	function	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	be	involve	in	the	regulation	of	plexin-b1	in	cervical	cancer	
as	a	result	when	<RNA_Name>	be	over-expressed	in	<Protein_Name>	<RNA_Name>	the	expression	of	plexin-b1	mrna	and	protein	be	significantly	decrease	compare	to	that	in	<Protein_Name>	neg-ctrl	
the	specific	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	plexin-b1	3'utr	to	inhibit	egfp	fluorescence	be	evident	in	<Protein_Name>	
this	observation	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	and	specifically	interact	with	plexin-b1	mrna	and	promote	plexin-b1	protein	silence	mostly	through	a	post-transcriptional	repression	mechanism	
these	data	show	that	elevated	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	can	cause	effect	similar	to	the	plexin-b1	knockdown	by	sirna	on	<Protein_Name>	cell	which	far	support	that	<RNA_Name>	affect	cell	function	via	downregulation	of	plexin-b1	
we	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	could	repress	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	bind	to	a	conserve	3'utr	site	of	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	
these	finding	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	suppress	<Protein_Name>	svneo	trophoblast	cell	migration	and	invasion	through	regulating	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	could	directly	target	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	decrease	its	expression	through	which	it	increase	the	number	and	volume	of	tumor	sphere	form	by	du145	cell	as	well	as	the	expression	of	csc	relate	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	gene	in	this	study	by	use	dual	luciferase	assay	and	western	blot	analysis	we	verify	that	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	suppress	its	expression	
another	interpretation	base	on	previous	result	would	be	that	<RNA_Name>	could	specifically	destabilise	hif-1alpha	mrna	but	not	shif-1alpha	transcript	result	in	large	amount	of	the	spliced	form	for	elevated	amount	of	<RNA_Name>	the	death	risk	for	patient	with	elevated	<RNA_Name>	transcript	concentration	be	<Number>	8-fold	that	in	patient	with	a	low	concentration	of	hif-1alpha	antisense	
bioinformatics	analysis	predict	that	<RNA_Name>	may	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	to	inhibit	its	translation	which	be	confirm	by	luciferase-reporter	assay	
the	luciferase	activity	be	quantify	in	these	cell	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	target	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	to	inhibit	its	translation

our	in	vitro	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	or	<RNA_Name>	regulated	<Protein_Name>	at	the	protein	level	
inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	and	or	<RNA_Name>	reduce	hepatic	apoptosis	and	<Protein_Name>	production	
we	search	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	find	that	it	contain	one	binding	site	for	<RNA_Name>	3a	to	prove	the	target	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	we	design	a	luciferase	assay	in	which	the	3'utr	sequence	of	<Protein_Name>	be	clone	into	a	luciferase	vector	and	co-transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	
when	a	mutate	<RNA_Name>	contain	mutation	in	the	seed	sequence	which	be	responsible	for	bind	to	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	use	the	target	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	be	abolish	3b	these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	specific	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	silence	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	likely	control	np	population	in	embryonic	cortex	
after	show	the	importance	of	mir-	<Number>	in	regulate	cslc	stemness	we	show	that	the	direct	target	of	mir-	<Number>	be	<Protein_Name>	an	essential	player	in	the	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	
take	together	these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	gene	of	mir-	<Number>	in	addition	we	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	a	negative	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	beta-catenin	signaling	be	a	target	gene	of	mir-	<Number>	
luciferase	reporter	and	western	blot	assay	show	that	il-10ralpha	expression	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	either	alone	or	in	combination

our	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	which	be	know	to	be	over-expressed	in	renal	fibrosis	significantly	up-regulates	apoptosis	of	hk-2	cell	as	well	as	increase	interstitial	deposition-related	gene	a-sma	type	i	collagen	and	<Protein_Name>	and	decrease	endothelial	cell	marker	endothelial	<Protein_Name>	and	we	also	identify	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	interact	with	the	<Number>	'	-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	while	<Protein_Name>	effectively	inhibit	the	hk-2	cell	apoptosis	and	interstitial	deposition	by	suppress	the	<Protein_Name>	b	catenin	signal	activation	
therefore	these	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
to	examine	the	possibility	of	<RNA_Name>	target	igf-ii	we	ask	whether	<RNA_Name>	regulated	igf-ii	expression

the	efficacy	of	deliver	oligonucleotides	into	muscle	might	not	be	optimal	but	the	observed	effect	be	significant	and	fully	consistent	with	<RNA_Name>	target	igf-ii	during	muscle	regeneration	in	vivo	
most	importantly	when	the	predict	<RNA_Name>	seed	region	in	the	3'utr	be	mutate	the	mutant	reporter	no	longer	respond	to	<RNA_Name>	strongly	suggest	that	the	predicted	site	be	a	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	it	be	solely	responsible	for	<RNA_Name>	targeting	of	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	be	unlikely	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	and	they	also	serve	as	negative	control	that	validate	the	reporter	assay	identify	<RNA_Name>	as	a	bona	fide	<Protein_Name>	regulator	
although	our	observation	do	not	definitively	eliminate	the	possibility	of	other	mirnas	and	or	target	site	be	involve	in	regulate	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	collectively	they	strongly	support	the	notion	that	<RNA_Name>	play	a	predominant	role	in	the	regulation	of	igf-ii	during	skeletal	myogenesis

no	appreciable	inhibitory	effect	be	observe	when	<RNA_Name>	mimic	or	nc	mimic	co-transfected	with	the	empty	vector	or	the	mutant	reporter	indicate	that	the	gsk3-beta	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	then	determine	that	the	tumor	suppressor	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	immunoblot	and	reporter	assay	independently	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	human	cell	
interestingly	quantification	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	indicate	a	certain	downregulation	of	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	in	sk-mes-1	cell	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	as	compare	with	control	microrna	even	though	the	p	value	be	not	significant	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	act	mainly	by	inhibit	the	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	inversely	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	level	in	<Protein_Name>	tumor	tissue	
we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	repress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	but	not	<Protein_Name>	or	<Protein_Name>	
to	determine	whether	fli-1	could	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	we	engineer	the	<Protein_Name>	luciferase	reporter	vector	to	contain	either	the	human	wild-type	full-length	human	fli-1	3'utr	or	its	mutant	form	harbor	a	6-base	deletion	in	the	four	putative	<RNA_Name>	targetsites	in	hek293	cell	cotransfection	of	the	luciferase	reporter	with	a	retroviral	vector	express	the	<RNA_Name>	result	in	a	<Number>	reduction	in	luciferase	expression	from	the	wild-type	fli-1	3'utr	reporter	
the	exogenous	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	could	negatively	regulate	mcl-1	or	bcl-2	expression	and	facilitate	chemotherapeutic	drug-triggered	apoptosis	
our	finding	attribute	stress-inducible	cognitive	impairment	to	cholinergic-mediated	induction	of	<RNA_Name>	and	consequently	suppress	ache-s	opening	venue	for	intercept	these	mir-132-mediated	damage	
therefore	if	ache-s	suppression	could	by	itself	prevent	stress-inducible	cognitive	decline	<Protein_Name>	mouse	should	show	no	such	decline	but	if	<RNA_Name>	increase	be	the	cause	then	these	mouse	should	present	a	stress	phenotype	
neuronal	<Protein_Name>	and	the	<Protein_Name>	activator	<Protein_Name>	be	both	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	finding	be	compatible	with	the	hypothesis	that	the	inter-individual	variability	in	hippocampal	<RNA_Name>	be	inversely	interlock	with	that	of	<Protein_Name>	
our	analysis	thus	attribute	the	observed	stress-inducible	cholinergic	hyper-excitation	to	the	feed-forward	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	transcript	and	show	that	avoid	<Protein_Name>	reduction	and	the	corresponding	breadth	of	inter-individual	variability	in	<RNA_Name>	associate	with	stress-inducible	cholinergic	hyper	excitation	and	cognitive	impairment	
<RNA_Name>	readily	form	complexes	with	the	<Protein_Name>	5'utr	fragment	while	<RNA_Name>	complex	formation	be	considerably	weak	with	the	<Protein_Name>	and	ompd	5'utrs

inversely	luciferase	activity	be	significantly	increase	in	the	cell	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	but	do	not	change	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	cell	
these	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	may	be	a	direct	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	
we	speculate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	down-regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	because	both	gene	be	express	in	the	same	subset	of	lymphocyte	they	have	opposite	expression	pattern	follow	stimulation	and	the	<RNA_Name>	gene	and	its	human	ortholog	encode	a	noncoding	rna

take	together	these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	at	both	transcript	and	protein	level	in	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	provide	further	evidence	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>

the	mutant	construct	exhibit	a	low	inhibitory	effect	on	luciferase	activity	compare	with	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	vector	after	<RNA_Name>	cotransfection	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	transcription	activity	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	bytargetingthe	bindingsite	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	independently	
collectively	these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	post-transcriptionally	
in	the	present	study	we	have	confirm	as	predict	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	and	that	truncation	of	the	3'utr	occurs	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	line	prevent	proper	<RNA_Name>	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
to	prove	that	this	truncation	alter	both	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	within	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	we	clone	the	truncated	version	from	all	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	cell	line

furthermore	we	identify	and	validate	matrix	metalloproteinase-2	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	our	data	reveal	for	the	first	time	that	<RNA_Name>	exerts	a	suppressive	effect	in	prostate	cancer	metastasis	through	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	tumor	metastasis	could	be	attribute	to	the	decreased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	which	have	be	identify	as	a	new	target	for	<RNA_Name>	
thesefindings	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	bind	to	its	<Number>	<Number>	-utr	
the	result	indicate	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	a	<Number>	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	and	a	<Number>	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	relative	to	control	while	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	partially	rescue	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein

these	result	indicate	that	the	abundance	of	api-5	protein	and	level	of	<RNA_Name>	be	inversely	relate	in	both	hcc	tissue	and	normal	liver	tissue	
thereby	provide	additional	evidence	of	direct	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	3'utr	region	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>

we	identify	<RNA_Name>	as	a	negative	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>

predict	bind	site	of	<RNA_Name>	in	3'utr	of	human	mcl-1	mrna	
furthermore	it	be	show	that	pdgf-b	be	a	targetfor	<RNA_Name>	as	evidence	by	the	fact	that	bind	of	<RNA_Name>	to	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	pdgf-b	mrna	result	in	its	translational	repression	in	sh-sy5y	cell

take	together	these	finding	implicate	that	tat-	and	morphine-stimulated	astrocyte	release	exosomes	contain	<RNA_Name>	which	can	be	take	up	by	neighbor	neuron	result	in	downregulation	of	the	expression	of	the	targetgene	-	pdgf-b	
these	result	thus	underpin	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	regulate	pdgf-b	protein	expression	via	a	posttranscriptional	mechanism	
these	result	indicate	the	requirement	for	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	for	the	deacetylase-induced	transcriptional	induction	of	<RNA_Name>	
more	importantly	there	be	a	strict	positive	correlation	between	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	up-regulation	of	mcm7-mir106b	indicating	that	<Protein_Name>	probably	positively	regulate	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	response	to	lbh589	in	primary	cll	cell	
we	also	showthat	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	anti-invasive	<RNA_Name>	that	be	down-regulated	in	tnbc	
we	show	that	<Protein_Name>	act	as	a	crucial	downstream	target	of	invasive	regulator	<RNA_Name>	and	that	its	oncogenic	function	require	<Protein_Name>	activity	
we	have	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	and	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	thus	up-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	could	be	a	result	of	<RNA_Name>	down-regulation	as	see	in	tnbc	
interestingly	<RNA_Name>	repress	the	protein	level	of	e-box-binding	transcription	factor	<Protein_Name>	also	know	as	smad-interacting	protein	<Number>	a	transcriptional	repressor	that	regulate	the	expression	of	e-cadherin	and	emt

<Protein_Name>	mrna	translation	in	rat	myoblasts	be	under	positive	control	by	<RNA_Name>	they	be	entirely	consistent	with	this	possibility	and	seem	to	constitute	a	provocative	case	
to	confirm	the	predicted	targetsite	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	we	mutate	the	binding	site	that	be	hypothesize	to	interact	with	the	seed	region	of	<RNA_Name>	
therefore	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	repress	the	<Protein_Name>	transcript	
this	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	post-transcriptionally	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	
dual	luciferase	assay	in	dgcr8d	dtbx21	<Protein_Name>	t	cell	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	primary	t	cell	
the	remain	three	gene	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	appear	to	be	direct	target	of	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
thus	these	result	show	that	two	keratinization-associated	mirnas	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	could	be	important	for	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
together	these	data	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	could	be	directly	coregulated	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	that	different	endogenous	level	of	these	mirnas	in	cell	could	contribute	to	the	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	transcript	
mage-a2	mage-a3	mage-a6	and	mage-a12	3'utrs	be	direct	target	for	<RNA_Name>

to	understand	the	mechanism	of	the	mir-491-regulated	hcc	cell	proliferation	and	cell	survival	we	try	to	identify	<RNA_Name>	target	gene	and	find	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	putative	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
to	validate	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	we	construct	luc-egfr-3'utr-wild-type	and	its	<Number>	utr	mutant	plasmid

the	result	show	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
consistent	with	the	western	blot	result	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	a	reduction	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	in	es	cell	in	summary	during	e	cell	differentiation	and	eb	formation	the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	decrease	whereas	its	regulatory	mirnas	display	an	inversely	correlated	expression	pattern

because	mirnas	usually	silence	target	gene	expression	the	overlapping	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	in	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	lead	us	to	examine	whether	<RNA_Name>	may	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	and	or	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	expression	
because	mirnas	function	by	silence	target	mrnas	the	reduction	in	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	neuron	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	directly	or	indirectly	repress	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	protein

this	elevated	expression	result	in	increased	ifn-alpha1	mrna	stability	because	of	the	cytoplasmic	interaction	of	the	as	rna	with	the	mrna	at	the	single-stranded	region	
these	data	thus	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	ifn-alpha1	as	rna	may	compete	for	bind	to	ifn-alpha1	mrna	
we	find	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	be	involve	in	b-cell	differentiation	process	through	posttranscriptional	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>

on	the	basis	of	these	data	we	propose	that	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	through	direct	targeting	of	its	transcription	factor	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
we	far	discover	that	<RNA_Name>	knockdown	significantly	inhibit	cell	proliferation	and	anchorage-independent	growth	suppress	s-phase	entry	and	inhibit	cell	migration	and	invasion	in	multiple	in	vitro	<Protein_Name>	model	
consistent	to	this	finding	there	be	a	significant	positive	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	primary	eacs	
to	investigate	whether	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	clone	into	a	luciferase	reporter	plasmid	
we	subsequently	assess	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	after	transfection	of	the	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	or	malat1-shrna1	into	endothelial	cell	and	find	that	the	decreased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	response	to	malat1-shrna1	could	be	block	by	<RNA_Name>	knockdown	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	protect	endothelial	cell	partly	via	compete	with	<RNA_Name>	which	result	in	the	upregulation	of	<Protein_Name>

<RNA_Name>	direct	target	<Protein_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	
nevertheless	qrt-pcr	analysis	of	<Protein_Name>	show	that	<RNA_Name>	have	no	effect	on	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	
these	result	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	the	translational	level	
these	result	strongly	suggest	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	her2-positive	breast	cancer	cell	can	interfere	with	the	aggressive	phenotype	by	direct	suppress	<Protein_Name>	expression	
moreover	the	mutation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	her2-3'utr	prevent	the	down-regulation	of	luciferase	expression	support	the	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	can	direct	bind	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	and	that	the	seed	site	be	necessary	for	the	binding

take	together	<RNA_Name>	could	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	bind	the	targetsites	in	their	3'-utrs	
however	the	luciferase	activity	with	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	or	its	mutant	form	be	not	alter	after	<RNA_Name>	transfection	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	but	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>

a	strong	inverse	relationship	between	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	show	
a	substantial	reduction	in	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	far	demonstrate	upon	restoration	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	hcc	cell	line	
we	further	show	that	<RNA_Name>	readily	could	suppress	the	luciferase	activity	in	reporter	construct	contain	the	<Protein_Name>	3'untranslated	region	
this	mir-145-mediated	suppression	of	cell	invasion	be	in	part	due	to	the	silencing	of	the	metastasis	gene	<Protein_Name>	<Number>

these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	be	key	in	regulate	cell	proliferation	cell	cycle	and	apoptosis	through	target	<Protein_Name>	in	addition	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	may	be	a	potential	therapeutic	strategy	in	the	treatment	of	hcc	
to	further	confirm	<Protein_Name>	as	a	<RNA_Name>	target	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	region	be	mutate	by	site	direct	mutagenesis	as	show	in	figure	5b	the	cell	express	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	mutant	construct	fail	to	show	reduction	in	the	luciferase	activity	in	the	presence	of	<RNA_Name>	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	appear	to	target	only	the	full	length	<Protein_Name>	isoform	and	not	the	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	isoform	as	it	lack	the	3'utr	
the	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	mimic	show	dramatic	growth	inhibition	in	cell	line	with	1p36	hemizygous	deletion	
expression	of	<RNA_Name>	be	also	decrease	in	primary	tumor	with	1p36	deletion	but	no	mutation	be	discover	in	resequencing	of	the	<RNA_Name>	locus	in	<Number>	neuroblastoma	cell	line	
<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	identify	as	<RNA_Name>	target	and	likely	mediator	of	the	tumor	suppressor	phenotypic	effect	
when	<RNA_Name>	rna	be	induce	it	result	in	the	destabilization	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	the	
degradation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	mediate	by	<RNA_Name>	no	longer	occur	in	a	newly	construct	strain	totally	lack	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	
the	<RNA_Name>	level	in	the	<Protein_Name>	strain	be	significantly	decrease	as	presumed	because	of	its	reduced	stability	in	the	absence	of	<Protein_Name>	as	observe	in	other	hfq-binding	small	rnas	the	
find	that	<Protein_Name>	be	tightly	associate	with	rnase	e	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	associate	with	rnase	e	through	<Protein_Name>	
it	be	far	demonstrate	in	vitro	that	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	bind	the	3-	untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	and	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	blocked	tgf	--	beta1-	nduced	up-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	therefore	inhibited	emt	and	collagen	expression	
as	show	in	figure	5b	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hmrsv5	cell	attenuate	the	activity	of	wild-type	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	to	<Number>	which	be	not	find	in	the	mutant	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	
interestingly	western	blot	analysis	and	real-time	pcr	show	that	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	dramatically	down-regulated	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	but	do	not	alter	its	mrna	level	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	repress	the	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	but	do	not	induce	degradation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
because	fccgammar	cluster	induces	sflt-1	and	because	<RNA_Name>	be	show	to	negatively	regulate	sflt-1	we	ask	whether	<RNA_Name>	be	basally	express	in	monocyte	but	down-regulated	upon	fcgammar	activation	
figure	<Number>	fcgammar	cluster	down-regulates	<RNA_Name>	while	up-regulating	sflt-1	transcription	and	protein	synthesis	
these	data	be	consistent	with	cyclin	d1	protein	and	mrna	expression	pattern	in	differentiate	mescs	and	with	cyclin	d1	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	translational	repression	cyclin	
d1	protein	be	significantly	diminish	in	cell	transfected	with	pre-mir-302a	compare	to	its	level	in	cell	transfected	with	the	negative	control	pre-mir	while	cyclin	d1	mrna	be	express	at	the	same	level	in	cell	transfected	with	pre-mir-302a	and	negative	control	pre-mir	the	
<Protein_Name>	protein	level	be	increase	in	response	to	the	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hescs	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	also	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
additionally	the	transfection	of	pre-mir-302a	into	<Protein_Name>	cell	cause	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	to	decrease	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	even	in	a	heterologous	system	these	
data	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	-b	-c	and	-d	translationally	repress	cyclin	d1	in	hescs	
meanwhile	<RNA_Name>	could	induce	apoptosis	of	<Protein_Name>	
besides	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
therefore	we	perform	3'utr	reporter	assay	for	<RNA_Name>	interference	with	translation	use	reporter	construct	contain	wild-type	and	mutant	3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	have	previously	be	show	to	be	a	direct	targetby	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	
the	finding	indicate	that	some	of	the	<RNA_Name>	phenotype	in	prostate	cancer	cell	could	be	mediate	by	mir-1-induced	disturbance	of	the	<Protein_Name>	filament	network	by	directly	target	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	among	other	candidate	transcript	that	encode	<Protein_Name>	bind	partner	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	induces	re-localization	of	<Protein_Name>	from	the	nucleus	into	the	cytoplasm	which	could	be	a	compensatory	process	follow	lasp-1	down-regulation	by	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	bind	to	its	3'utr	in	response	to	mild	dna	damage	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	decrease	result	in	enhanced	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	which	in	turn	reduce	its	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	inhibiting	apoptosis	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	down-regulated	by	<Protein_Name>	signal	and	they	repress	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	conserve	mirna	bind	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'-untranslated	region	
take	together	these	result	be	consistent	with	the	conclusion	that	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	specifically	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	targetthe	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
bioinformatics	analysis	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	have	a	putative	binding	site	within	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	repress	its	expression	in	nsclc	cell	
transfection	experiment	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	repress	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
this	confirm	that	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	that	the	<RNA_Name>	targetis	locate	in	the	region	of	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	mutation	
in	this	paper	we	report	that	a	star	strand	mirna	<RNA_Name>	be	induce	by	the	protein	kinase	rna	activated-	ike	er	kinase	pathway	of	the	upr	and	governs	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	a	key	transcription	factor	that	augment	secretory	capacity	and	promotes	cell	survival	in	the	adaptive	upr	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	be	functionally	competent	and	recognize	the	predicted	cognate	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	target	site	in	a	sequence-specific	manner	
these	data	establish	that	<RNA_Name>	have	the	capacity	to	limit	induction	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	xbp1-dependent	target	gene	
moreover	our	result	show	that	key	signal	molecular	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	directly	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	attenuate	the	release	of	proinflammatory	cytokine	tnf-alpha	in	pa-activated	monocyte	thp-1	
we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	which	be	activate	by	pa	through	directly	negative	<Protein_Name>	expression	
as	show	in	figure	2e	<RNA_Name>	downregulated	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	while	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	upregulated	<Protein_Name>	
all	of	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	regulates	angiogenesis	of	hcc	tec	and	<Protein_Name>	be	the	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	result	indicate	the	silence	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	induce	in	hcc1937	brca1-expressing	cell	bindand	regulate	<Protein_Name>	gene	
collectively	these	luciferase	and	western	blot	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	act	as	negative	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
we	have	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	novel	targetgene	for	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	show	that	these	mirnas	be	sufficient	to	modulate	nf-jb	pathway	activity	in	breast	cancer	cell	
interestingly	there	be	no	significant	change	in	luciferase	activity	when	mutant	utr	be	co-transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	suggest	that	alteration	of	luciferase	activity	be	because	of	direct	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	to	the	predict	binding	site	on	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	group	have	a	significant	negative	correlation	relationship	with	the	expression	of	downstream	target	of	b	-catenin	
<RNA_Name>	may	inhibit	the	hcc	cell	growth	through	down-regulating	the	expression	of	b	-catenin	
therefore	the	negative	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	on	b	-catenin	expression	which	be	confirm	by	the	present	study	may	have	the	important	clinical	value	to	ameliorate	the	treatment	and	prognosis	of	sorafenib	resistant	patient	
further	study	determine	that	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	ectopic	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	totally	rescue	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	crc	growth	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	by	direct	binding	to	site1	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	crc	
our	current	study	show	that	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	inhibition	of	crc	occurrence	
utilize	human	cell	line	we	demonstrate	that	mirnas	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	bindto	their	predicted	targetsequences	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	negatively	regulate	reporter	gene	expression

over-expression	of	these	mirnas	but	not	control	mirnas	result	in	translational	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	significantly	reduces	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
we	observe	that	<RNA_Name>	over-expression	significantly	decreased	luciferase	activity	when	the	putative	<RNA_Name>	targetsite	be	include	in	the	reporter	compare	to	either	a	reporter	lack	the	putative	targetsite	or	a	reporter	carry	a	seed-region	mutant	of	the	putative	<RNA_Name>	targetsite	
in	a	screening	of	<RNA_Name>	cell	line	the	mirna	<RNA_Name>	be	see	to	be	a	regulator	of	the	<Protein_Name>	pathway	through	its	targeting	of	the	transcription	factor	<Protein_Name>	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	proliferation	rate	and	anchorage-independent	growth	of	<RNA_Name>	cell

these	data	show	the	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	in	metastatic	<Protein_Name>	suggest	a	potential	silencing	mechanism	through	epigenetic	or	genetic	alteration	
infection	with	<RNA_Name>	cell	in	an	induced	xenograft	model	in	the	mouse	cerebellum	and	the	use	of	an	adenovirus	carry	<RNA_Name>	indicate	a	clinical	benefit	through	this	negative	influence	of	<RNA_Name>	on	tumor	growth	and	on	the	subset	of	<RNA_Name>	stem-cell-like	cell	provide	further	proof	of	concept	
these	exploration	lead	to	the	identification	of	candidate	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	signal	include	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
to	verify	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	indeed	repress	post	transcriptionally	by	<RNA_Name>	we	determine	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	protein	expression

this	be	the	first	study	to	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	through	its	target	site	within	the	3'utr	
these	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	level	by	bind	to	its	3'utr	and	this	interaction	regulate	skeletal	muscle	insulin	signal	
these	result	imply	towards	a	specific	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	to	regulate	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	level	
all	these	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	decrease	<Protein_Name>	level	by	bind	to	its	3'utr	
we	further	analyzed	change	in	<RNA_Name>	an	ec-specific	mirna	that	regulate	vascular	integrity	by	suppress	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrnas	the	
<RNA_Name>	decrease	the	sensitivity	to	ifn-alpha	through	the	suppression	of	apoptosis	
further	experiment	show	that	mir-146a-related	resistance	to	ifn-alpha	be	mediate	through	<Protein_Name>	
then	western	blot	analysis	and	luciferase	reporter	assay	be	measure	to	determine	whether	<Protein_Name>	be	indeed	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	modulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	via	its	3'utr

figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	glioma	cell	line	
take	together	these	data	imply	that	<RNA_Name>	may	attenuate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	target	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	conclusion	<Protein_Name>	gene	confirm	<RNA_Name>	targetgenes	through	luciferase	activity	and	western	blotting

finally	<Protein_Name>	largely	abrogate	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	proliferation	invasion	and	apoptosis	of	glioma	cell	in	rescue	experiment	which	verify	the	role	of	<Protein_Name>	in	<RNA_Name>	regulating	glioma	biological	behavior	
in	conclusion	our	data	suggest	the	expression	level	of	<RNA_Name>	be	positively	relate	to	glioma	grade	and	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	affect	proliferation	invasion	and	apoptosis	of	glioma	cell	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
we	identify	<RNA_Name>	as	a	putative	therapeutic	target	and	<Protein_Name>	as	a	potential	tumor	suppressor	
base	on	the	above	we	prove	that	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	by	regulate	3'utr	at	the	post-transcription	level	
notably	we	identify	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	while	depletion	of	<RNA_Name>	increase	<Protein_Name>	level	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	could	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
our	finding	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	promote	cell	migration	and	invasion	through	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	and	its	target	e-cadherin	
here	our	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	and	lead	to	increase	migration	and	invasion	in	crc	cell	
<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	predict	to	induce	hematopoietic	differentiation	due	to	target	<Protein_Name>	in	different	level	
we	hypothesize	<RNA_Name>	and	hsa-mir-219-5p	have	potential	for	target	<Protein_Name>	
as	predict	by	mirbase	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	have	complementary	sequence	for	has-mir-15b	and	has-mir-219-5p	seed	sequence	
these	result	indicate	that	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	consequently	up	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	lead	to	in	the	expansion	of	primary	hscs	
base	on	our	analysis	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	reduce	its	expression	in	hscs

take	together	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	bind	its	gene	at	3'utr	in	our	study	a	novel	function	and	mechanism	of	<RNA_Name>	be	find	in	its	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	suppression	of	melanogenesis	in	a	normal	melanocyte	model	of	murine	melan-a	cell	
a	luciferase	activity	assay	demonstrate	the	direct	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	to	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene

these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
the	data	far	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	target	and	regulate	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	expression	be	dramatically	reduce	after	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	
altogether	these	data	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	suppress	the	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	bind	to	the	itga2-3'utr	
to	far	evaluate	the	putative	differential	targeting	of	the	<RNA_Name>	5-	-isomirs	we	select	the	following	three	gene	<Protein_Name>	which	regulate	insulin	secretion	be	a	known	target	of	the	5-	-reference	<RNA_Name>	but	be	not	predict	to	be	target	by	the	5-	-shifted	isoforms	<Protein_Name>	which	mediate	glucose-sensitive	intracellular	vesicular	transport	and	be	predict	to	be	preferentially	target	by	the	5-	-shifted	isoform	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	and	<Protein_Name>	which	be	essential	for	the	second	phase	of	insulin	secretion	and	be	predict	to	be	preferentially	target	by	the	5-	-shifted	isoform	<RNA_Name>	
use	microarray	and	bioinformatics	analysis	pgc-1alpha	be	identify	as	a	common	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	which	be	mainly	locate	in	the	intima	of	atherosclerotic	vessel	in	vitro	induction	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	by	the	inflammatory	cytokine	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	may	affect	pgc-1alpha	protein	production	and	consequently	result	in	mitochondrial	dysfunction	in	human	aortic	endothelial	cell	
take	together	these	result	suggest	that	the	drastic	increase	in	the	expression	level	of	micrornas	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	atherosclerotic	vessel	modulate	pgc-1alpha	protein	production	via	target	the	3'utr	of	pgc-1alpha	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	the	8-hpi	network	show	a	number	of	deregulated	mirnas	and	their	predicted	target	include	<RNA_Name>	that	be	consistently	upregulated	throughout	infection	with	h1n1	
furthermore	as	show	by	quantitative	real-time	rt-pcr	and	western	blotting	ectopic	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	reduce	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	at	both	the	mrna	and	protein	level	
knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	increase	in	both	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	
thus	these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
together	with	the	observed	<RNA_Name>	effect	on	igf1-induced	<Protein_Name>	activation	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	tscc	cell	growth	at	least	in	part	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	which	target	<Protein_Name>	mediates	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	-induced	cancer	cell	migration

we	test	whether	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	by	generate	luciferase	reporter	construct	with	wild-type	and	<RNA_Name>	seed	sequence-mutated	<Protein_Name>	3'-utrs	in	addition	we	test	whether	other	micrornas	which	have	no	predict	target	site	on	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	might	affect	<Protein_Name>	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	do	not	modify	<Protein_Name>	transcript	level	
thus	our	data	demonstrate	a	role	for	<RNA_Name>	regulating	<Protein_Name>	expression	level	in	myogenic	cell	
restoration	of	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	expression	during	kaposi	sarcoma	herpesvirus	infection	attenuate	viral	induction	of	<Protein_Name>	
together	these	result	demonstrate	that	the	highly	conserved	molecular	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	by	the	<RNA_Name>	family	regulate	angiogenesis	
figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	regulate	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	these	data	indicate	that	the	<RNA_Name>	family	regulate	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	influence	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	endothelial	cell	by	target	a	predict	site	within	its	3'utr	
tsp-1	be	the	main	target	of	mir-467	and	the	main	mediator	in	regulation	of	angiogenesis	
the	experiment	with	the	construct	in	which	the	binding	site	for	mir-467	be	mutate	demonstrate	that	the	direct	binding	of	mir-467	to	the	3'utr	of	tsp-1	be	require	for	the	translational	silencing	of	tsp-1	mrna	in	response	to	high	glucose	
mutation	of	the	mir-467	binding	site	in	tsp-1	3'utr	or	mir-467	inhibitor	relieve	the	translational	silencing	and	restore	tsp-1	production	
<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	level	be	markedly	upregulated	and	downregulated	in	hcc	tissue	
the	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	tissue	be	significantly	correlate	with	the	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	hcc	tissue	
the	time	course	of	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	phospho-hsp20	in	the	spinal	cord	after	the	transient	ischemia	indicate	that	expression	of	phospho-hsp20	be	negatively	correlate	with	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	
transfection	of	antagomir-320	significantly	reduce	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	spinal	cord	and	dramatically	up-regulated	expression	of	phospho-hsp20	
to	unravel	the	mechanism	by	which	<RNA_Name>	restrains	g1	s	transition	we	examine	possible	cell	cycle-related	target	of	<Protein_Name>	cyclin	a2	cyclin	e1	cyclin	d1	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
we	find	that	induction	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	cyclin	a2	at	the	mrna	level	in	both	t24	and	<Number>	cell	line	whereas	cyclin	e1	cyclin	d1	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	almost	unchanged	compare	with	nc-transfectants	
<RNA_Name>	act	as	a	tumor	suppressor	by	target	n-ras	and	enhance	temozolomide-induced	apoptosis	in	glioma	
expression	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	decreased	ovarian	cancer	cell	migration	invasion	and	metastasis	mainly	through	target	<Protein_Name>	
although	our	data	only	reflect	mrna	level	and	some	gene	might	be	affect	translationally	we	decide	to	focus	on	<Protein_Name>	as	the	major	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	ovarian	cancer	
co-expression	of	anti-mir-708	fully	reverse	mir-708-mediated	inhibition	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	reduce	the	activity	of	a	luciferase	reporter	gene	<Protein_Name>	to	the	wild-type	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	but	have	no	effect	on	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	or	<Protein_Name>	
to	test	the	binding	specificity	of	<RNA_Name>	specific	base	pair	mutation	on	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	perform	use	the	site-directed	mutagenesis	method	follow	by	co-transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	
this	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	addition	we	observe	significant	expression	of	the	luciferase	reporter	gene	<Protein_Name>	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	after	anti-mir-10b	treatment	
to	determine	whether	<RNA_Name>	could	disrupt	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	endothelial	cell	cell	lysates	from	mir-10b-transfected	or	vector	control	hmec-1	cell	be	analyze	
although	<RNA_Name>	slightly	inhibit	mrna	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	hmec-1	cell	it	might	impair	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	translational	inhibition	
indeed	expression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	significantly	reduce	in	cell	that	overexpressed	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	indeed	an	important	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hmec-1	
our	result	show	that	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	up-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	implicate	in	this	process	
in	this	study	we	first	investigate	the	effect	of	atorvastatin	on	<RNA_Name>	and	its	target	gene	i	e	vascular	cell	adhesion	molecule-1	in	<Protein_Name>	e-knockout	mouse	with	carotid	atherosclerotic	plaque	in	vivo	
these	data	indicate	that	the	down-regulated	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	the	up-regulated	expression	of	vcam-1	be	involve	in	atherosclerotic	formation	and	that	treatment	with	atorvastatin	regulate	the	level	of	<RNA_Name>	mrna	expression	
loss	of	<RNA_Name>	also	increase	cleavage	of	caspase-3	and	increased	phosphorylation	of	elongation	factor-2	in	both	cell	line	
our	study	indicate	regulation	of	pdcd-4	expression	be	not	a	primary	<RNA_Name>	function	in	leiomyoma	but	instead	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	impact	cellular	apoptosis	and	translation	through	unknown	target	in	a	manner	consistent	with	its	involvement	in	the	pathophysiology	of	uterine	fibroid	
therefore	we	conclude	that	the	inserted	fragment	of	igf-ir	be	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
furthermore	our	study	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	two	direct	targetgenes	of	<RNA_Name>	and	forced	expression	of	either	of	them	can	reverse	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	on	inhibit	cell	viability	and	promote	apoptosis	of	human	mll-rearranged	leukemic	cell	
finally	our	luciferase	reporter	and	mutagenesis	assay	show	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'utr	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	directly	
thus	several	line	of	evidence	indicate	that	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	targetgenes	of	<RNA_Name>	
therefore	our	data	suggest	that	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	functionally	important	targetgenes	of	<RNA_Name>	in	mll-rearranged	leukemic	cell	
to	validate	the	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	luciferase	reporter	assay	be	perform	with	wild-type	and	seed-sequence	mutate	<RNA_Name>	target	sequence	of	<RNA_Name>	
when	<RNA_Name>	precursor	be	cotransfected	with	the	putative	<RNA_Name>	target	sequence	of	<RNA_Name>	in	bel7402	cell	the	luciferase	signal	be	significantly	suppress	as	compare	to	the	empty	vector	control	while	the	suppressive	effect	be	significantly	attenuate	when	the	putative	binding	site	be	mutate	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	downregulated	by	bind	of	<RNA_Name>	to	its	3'utr	
the	predicted	seed	region	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
mutation	in	the	predicted	<RNA_Name>	seed	region	abolish	this	repression	thus	strongly	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	the	predicted	targetsite	in	the	ratgr	mrna	
interestingly	<RNA_Name>	up-regulation	be	associate	with	a	<Number>	reduction	of	gr	protein	suggest	an	interaction	between	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	and	gr	mrna	
furthermore	<RNA_Name>	induced	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	by	directly	target	its	<Number>	'	-untranslated	region	
base	on	the	collective	result	we	propose	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	protein	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	target	its	3'utr	region	
use	bioinformatic	analysis	we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	be	a	potential	target	for	<RNA_Name>	
luciferase	assay	be	perform	to	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	the	seed	region	of	<Protein_Name>	3'-untranslated	region	
we	also	find	that	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	lacking	in	3'utr	abrogate	the	anti-invasion	and	pro-apoptosis	function	of	<RNA_Name>	
our	result	demonstrate	the	importance	of	<RNA_Name>	in	target	<Protein_Name>	for	the	regulation	of	esophagus	cancer	growth	invasion	and	apoptosis	and	may	be	helpful	for	develop	new	target	for	early	diagnosis	or	new	therapeutic	target	for	escc	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	seed	region	in	escc	
as	in	e	coli	induction	of	the	<RNA_Name>	srnas	lead	to	the	rapid	loss	of	mrna	for	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	a	gene	encode	a	bacterioferritin	
thus	the	<RNA_Name>	srnas	be	the	functional	homologs	of	<RNA_Name>	srna	
we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	an	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	and	<RNA_Name>	target	indeed	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	effect	on	colony	formation	be	rescue	by	<Protein_Name>	depletion	
increase	firefly	activity	be	not	observe	when	reporter	with	mutated	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	bindsg	site	be	transfected	
furthermore	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	mrna	as	well	as	protein	level	be	elevate	when	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	be	inhibit	of	note	protein	level	be	much	strong	increase	than	mrna	level	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	may	preferentially	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	translation	
we	also	observe	a	significant	rescue	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	although	not	as	strong	as	observe	for	<RNA_Name>	
indeed	overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	reduce	the	number	of	<Protein_Name>	cell	suggest	that	the	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	effect	be	at	least	in	part	due	to	<Protein_Name>	inhibition	
strikingly	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	or	<RNA_Name>	increase	<Protein_Name>	and	npr-a	expression	presumably	by	induce	<Protein_Name>	expression	
take	together	we	have	find	that	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	and	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	expression	of	the	novel	tumour	suppressor	<Protein_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	glioblastoma	cell	and	<Protein_Name>	itself	stimulate	the	expression	of	the	anti-proliferative	peptide	<Protein_Name>	
real-time	pcr	analysis	reveal	that	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	drastically	repress	the	expression	level	of	mmp-9	mrna	in	u87mg	and	snb19	glioma	cell	which	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	mediate	the	downregulation	of	mmp-9	at	the	transcriptional	level	
take	together	our	result	suggest	that	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	reduces	mmp-9	expression	and	inactivate	nf-jb	signaling	
however	by	correct	the	statistical	analysis	exclude	double	positive	case	in	which	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	not	express	by	the	same	cell	we	observe	a	significant	inverse	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	data	far	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	also	in	breast	cancer	tissue	
moreover	the	mutation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	prevent	the	downregulation	of	luciferase	expression	
computational	analysis	predict	that	<RNA_Name>	have	two	conserve	bind	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
to	further	validate	that	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	signi	antly	increase	luciferase	activity	when	compare	to	human	cardiomyocytes	transfected	with	mirna	inhibitor	negative	control	transfected	cell	
these	data	evidently	support	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	
the	result	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	directly	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	next	investigate	whether	<RNA_Name>	could	directly	down-regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	neuropathic	pain	model	by	western	blotting	analysis	
all	these	result	imply	that	<RNA_Name>	might	suppress	<Protein_Name>	in	neuropathic	pain	model	
theseresults	demonstrate	the	specific	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	<RNA_Name>	
collectively	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	myoblast	proliferation	by	target	the	proliferation-associated	gene	<Protein_Name>	and	p85a	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	modulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	bind	<RNA_Name>	seed	complementary	site	locate	in	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
furthermore	rt-pcr	and	western	blot	analysis	show	that	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	in	lscc	cell	lead	to	increase	level	of	<RNA_Name>	and	decreased	level	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	
hsa-mir-125b	suppresses	bladder	cancer	development	by	down-regulating	oncogene	<Protein_Name>	and	oncogenic	long	non-coding	rna	<RNA_Name>	
luciferase	activity	be	reduce	<Number>	by	<RNA_Name>	expression	but	not	by	<RNA_Name>	expression	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	indeed	target	the	3'utr	of	gata-2	mrna	in	this	cell	type	
take	together	these	result	demonstrate	that	son	knockdown	up-regulates	<RNA_Name>	which	in	turn	target	the	3'utr	of	gata-2	and	down-regulates	gata-2	expression	
our	data	reveal	that	reduction	of	the	son	level	lead	to	depletion	of	the	protein	level	of	hematopoietic	transcription	factor	gata-2	and	this	be	mediate	by	<RNA_Name>	target	gata-2	3'utr	
we	also	observe	that	the	3'utr	of	gata-2	with	<RNA_Name>	bind	site	mutate	be	still	affect	albeit	less	by	son	sirna	which	suggest	other	mirnas	in	addition	to	<RNA_Name>	regulate	by	the	son	level	also	targetthis	3'utr	to	contribute	to	fine-tuning	of	the	gata-2	protein	level	
the	dual-luciferase	reporter	gene	assay	result	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	be	associate	with	<Protein_Name>	and	both	of	them	may	be	involve	in	hcc	tumorigenesis	
furthermore	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	mimic	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	increase	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	hepg2	cell	at	protein	but	not	mrna	level	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	could	be	inhibit	by	<RNA_Name>	at	post-transcriptional	level	
together	the	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	could	regulate	the	expression	of	endogenous	human	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	human	<Protein_Name>	be	a	new	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	most	likely	involve	in	the	induction	of	cell	cycle	arrest	by	<RNA_Name>	
our	data	suggest	the	frequently	downregulated	<RNA_Name>	can	regulate	<Protein_Name>	and	function	as	a	tumor	suppressor	in	hcc	
since	<RNA_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<Protein_Name>	in	many	pathway	<Number>	we	next	use	<Protein_Name>	sufficient	and	deficient	cell	line	hct116	<Protein_Name>	cell	and	hct116	p53-	-	cell	to	study	the	possible	relationship	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	radio-sensitivity	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	positively	correlate	to	cellular	radio-sensitivity	and	the	induction	of	<RNA_Name>	be	in	a	<Protein_Name>	dependent	manner	
these	result	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	mimic	transfection	downregulated	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	mesothelioma	cell	
here	we	add	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	its	prediction	target	<Protein_Name>	gene	as	possible	target	of	therapeutic	potential	in	mesothelioma	
in	addition	by	transfecting	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	mimic	to	two	cell	line	acc-meso-1	and	crl-5915	we	also	find	the	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	suggest	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
the	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	relate	to	cardiac	hypertrophy	or	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	relate	to	myocardial	fibrosis	be	significantly	increase	in	the	heart	tissue	of	diabetic	mouse	
over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	increase	cell	invasion	whereas	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	decrease	cell	invasion	via	modulate	the	level	of	the	target	<Protein_Name>	
the	present	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	cell	invasion	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	act	as	prognostic	factor	for	glioma	patient	
furthermore	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	decreased	invasion	capability	reduce	tumor	growth	and	up-regulated	the	expression	of	the	target	<Protein_Name>	whereas	ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	exhibit	the	opposite	effect	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	can	directly	modulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	in	glioma	
in	silico	analysis	predict	two	putative	<RNA_Name>	target	site	locate	in	the	<Protein_Name>	region	of	<Protein_Name>	instead	of	regular	3'utr	mirna	binding	site	
employ	luciferase	reporter	assay	we	far	prove	that	the	<RNA_Name>	regulates	expression	of	its	host	gene	<Protein_Name>	via	the	bind	<Protein_Name>	region	of	<Protein_Name>	
consistently	we	observe	<RNA_Name>	downregulated	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	s2	cell	and	the	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	at	both	protein	and	rna	level	
furthermore	we	find	cds-located	site1	be	dominant	for	regulate	expression	of	host	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	support	the	idea	that	<Protein_Name>	may	be	a	bona	fide	target	of	its	intronic	<RNA_Name>	
our	result	show	that	<Protein_Name>	region	of	host	<Protein_Name>	could	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	and	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	as	well	as	its	mrna	be	decrease	by	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	the	above	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	target	icam-1	3'utr	result	in	posttranscriptional	suppression	in	cholangiocytes	
moreover	no	significant	change	in	icam-1	mrna	level	be	find	between	the	control	cell	and	cell	treat	with	anti-mir-221	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	do	not	induce	icam-1	mrna	degradation	
luciferase	reporter	assay	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	that	encode	the	proteasome	activator	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	our	study	identify	<RNA_Name>	replacement	as	the	first-in-class	mir-based	<Protein_Name>	that	also	disrupt	the	autophagy	pathway	and	highlight	their	potential	to	synergistically	enhance	the	antimyeloma	effect	of	bortezomib	
in	addition	<RNA_Name>	bound	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	then	inhibit	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
overall	these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	for	<RNA_Name>	in	huvecs	and	it	may	promote	the	process	of	angiogenesis	in	vitro	
we	demonstrate	herein	that	an	microrna	<RNA_Name>	be	a	new	component	in	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	network	be	transcriptionally	activate	by	<Protein_Name>	and	post-transcriptionally	repress	<Protein_Name>	
these	analyse	suggest	a	possibility	of	<RNA_Name>	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	on	one	hand	and	to	be	regulate	in	its	own	expression	at	the	transcriptional	level	by	<Protein_Name>	on	the	other	hand	
figure	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	for	post-transcriptional	repression

additionally	the	mrna	and	protein	level	of	the	pro-apoptotic	gene	<Protein_Name>	be	down-regulated	by	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	and	up-regulated	by	<RNA_Name>	deficiency	
the	luciferase	reporter	assay	confirm	<Protein_Name>	to	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	decrease	in	rasfs	after	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	but	increase	with	the	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	
this	evidence	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	modulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	the	translational	level	by	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	translation	via	interaction	with	its	3'-untranslated	region	and	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	t	cell	can	significantly	reduce	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
take	together	these	data	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	up-regulation	contributes	to	the	reduction	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	t	cell	
igure	<Number>	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	<Protein_Name>	t	cell	and	identification	of	<Protein_Name>	as	an	<RNA_Name>	target	three	day	after	transfection	with	psilencer-mir-126	<RNA_Name>	transcript	be	increase	by	<Number>	68-fold	while	those	of	the	unrelated	<RNA_Name>	gene	remain	unchanged	
indeed	cox-2	protein	expression	be	suppress	by	the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	the	luciferase	activity	of	reporter	construct	contain	the	cox-2	3'utr	be	also	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	
to	determine	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	mammary	gland	we	analyze	the	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	and	cyclooxygenase-2	
cox-2	protein	expression	slightly	decrease	by	dip	stimulation	and	additionally	decrease	after	the	depletion	of	dip	show	an	inverse	relationship	with	the	expression	pattern	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	then	analyze	change	in	cox-2	protein	expression	in	response	to	the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	find	that	cox-2	be	clearly	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	
furthermore	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	reduce	the	luciferase	activity	of	construct	contain	the	cox-2	<Number>	'	-utr	when	compare	to	those	contain	the	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	'	-utr	
far	<RNA_Name>	be	find	to	increase	expression	of	e-cadherin	and	cytokeratin	but	suppress	expression	of	n-cadherin	and	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	a	novel	mechanism	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	emt	and	inhibits	cell	migration	via	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	may	function	as	anti-migration	and	anti-metastasis	in	gist	and	our	study	provide	a	potential	approach	for	develop	mir-137-based	therapeutic	strategy	for	gist	
furthermore	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	negatively	correlate	with	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	nsclcs	tissue	indicate	the	possible	translation	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	
this	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	nsclcs	cell	
these	data	suggest	that	the	upregulated	<RNA_Name>	in	nsclcs	enhances	the	cell	proliferation	but	retard	cell	apoptosis	via	<Protein_Name>	
further	investigation	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	myoblasts	
this	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	target	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	
more	importantly	the	present	study	identify	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	new	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	c2c12	cell	
<RNA_Name>	inhibits	ht1080	cell	proliferation	vascularization	and	metastasis	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	fibrosarcoma	ht1080	cell	result	in	decreased	steady-state	level	of	<Protein_Name>	transcript	and	<Protein_Name>	production	which	be	achieve	through	direct	binding	of	this	mirna	to	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	binding	to	its	3'utr	
this	may	be	explain	by	the	fact	that	<RNA_Name>	increase	in	colorectal	cancer	case	in	order	to	inhibit	increased	activity	of	lc3b-ii	in	autophagy	and	<Protein_Name>	against	apoptosis	posttranscriptionally	and	to	take	role	as	tumor	suppressor	
the	signal	from	a	luciferase	reporter	be	significantly	decrease	at	one	<RNA_Name>	targetsite	at	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	
this	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	cleavage	or	translational	inhibition

collectively	our	data	suggest	vegf-c	be	down-regulated	by	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	
thus	it	be	conclude	that	<Protein_Name>	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	cervical	cancer	cell	
base	on	the	identification	of	complementary	binding	site	in	<RNA_Name>	and	igf-1r	mrna	it	be	propose	that	<RNA_Name>	act	as	a	local	regulator	of	igf-1r	
addition	proliferation	apoptosis	and	differentiation	be	assay	in	these	two	hesc	population	and	be	compare	in	the	presence	of	exogenous	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor

<Protein_Name>	be	verify	to	be	directly	interact	with	<RNA_Name>	and	its	subsequent	upregulation	reverse	the	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	upregulation	in	osteosarcoma	
therefore	the	experiment	of	luciferase	assay	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	our	work	of	dual-luciferase	assay	and	qrt-pcr	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	link	with	<RNA_Name>	in	human	osteosarcoma

these	result	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	decrease	it	expression	
real-time	rt-pcr	analysis	detect	a	slight	reduction	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	<RNA_Name>	cell	compare	with	the	vector	control	in	mda-mb-231	or	lm2-4142	cell	but	this	difference	be	not	significant	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	silence	<Protein_Name>	mainly	at	the	translational	level	
experimental	metastasis	assay	far	support	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	suppress	invasion	and	metastasis	by	target	<Protein_Name>

together	our	result	highlight	the	significance	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	the	development	and	progression	of	nsclc	
<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	attenuate	<Protein_Name>	upregulation	and	mitochondrial	fission	by	bind	to	the	amino	acid	cod	sequence	of	<Protein_Name>	and	inhibit	its	translation	
in	explore	the	underlie	mechanism	of	<RNA_Name>	downregulation	upon	apoptosis	we	observe	that	<Protein_Name>	transactivates	<RNA_Name>	expression	
our	present	study	show	that	<RNA_Name>	can	repress	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	be	able	to	inhibit	mitochondrial	fission	through	target	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	target	the	amino	acid	cod	sequence	of	<Protein_Name>	
we	also	generate	mutated	luciferase	construct	and	introduce	these	construct	into	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
we	find	that	the	binding	site	be	responsible	for	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
our	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	target	<Protein_Name>	directly	and	that	<Protein_Name>	may	contribute	to	chemoresistance	
these	data	suggest	that	a	clear	inverse	correlation	exist	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	level	and	bmi-1	expression	
mutation	of	the	single	<RNA_Name>	site	rescue	the	luciferase	activity	thus	confirm	a	direct	interaction	of	<RNA_Name>	with	the	3'utr	of	bmi-1	mrna	
thus	after	determine	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'utr	of	bmi-1	as	well	as	downregulate	bmi-1	protein	level	we	next	want	to	determine	the	effect	of	these	mirnas	on	the	proliferation	and	clonal	growth	of	ovarian	cancer	cell	
these	result	prove	that	in	ovarian	cancer	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	indeed	regulate	proliferation	and	clonal	growth	through	downregulation	of	bmi-1	
ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	decreased	<Protein_Name>	expression	while	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	be	find	to	restore	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	kshv-infected	cell	
ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	inhibit	the	repair	of	dna	damage	induce	by	etoposide	lead	to	accumulation	of	dna	damage	increase	in	cell	apoptosis	and	poor	clonogenic	survival	<RNA_Name>	
dual-luciferase	report	assay	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	by	bind	its	3'utr	
we	provide	evidence	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	support	the	hypothesis	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	interact	to	and	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	bind	to	its	3'utr	mrna	
dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
luciferase	activity	be	significantly	repress	when	<RNA_Name>	be	co-expressed	with	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	whereas	luciferase	activity	in	mutated	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	do	not	change	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	bind	to	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
our	result	indicate	that	the	effect	of	stroke	serum	prim	on	the	increase	proliferation	rate	of	<Protein_Name>	be	relate	to	the	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	which	regulate	the	cell	cycle	inhibitor	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	
base	on	the	dual	luciferase	assay	and	western	blot	analysis	we	confirm	that	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	can	simultaneously	target	<Protein_Name>	and	modulate	its	expression	at	protein	level	
both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	modulate	its	expression	
by	screen	<Protein_Name>	enhancer	trap	with	a	uas-gfp-mcd8	reporter	we	find	that	insertion	upstream	of	the	<RNA_Name>	-311	-312	-313	cluster	exhibit	activity	in	larval	stage	motor	neuron	
these	result	be	consistent	with	khc-73	be	a	key	target	of	the	<RNA_Name>	cluster	
while	reduce	khc-73	in	motor	neuron	use	a	knockdown	transgene	do	not	significantly	affect	synaptic	transmission	overexpression	of	khc-73	induce	a	strong	increase	in	qc	phenocopying	the	effect	of	delete	the	<RNA_Name>	cluster	thus	far	support	the	link	between	khc-73	and	the	<RNA_Name>	cluster	
our	finding	show	that	khc-73	transgene	with	3'utr	be	much	more	sensitive	to	the	endogenous	level	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	together	provide	strong	evidence	indicate	that	khc-73	be	the	relevant	target	of	<RNA_Name>	cluster	in	vivo	and	provide	some	of	the	first	evidence	for	in	vivo	relationship	between	mirnas	and	their	target	through	seed	sequence	within	the	coding	region	
these	result	together	suggest	that	the	regulation	of	khc-73	by	<RNA_Name>	cluster	in	motor	neuron	be	essential	for	the	ability	of	retrograde	signalling	at	the	nmj	to	regulate	presynaptic	neurotransmitter	release

since	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	both	anti-apoptotic	protein	and	the	target	of	the	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	cluster	we	hypothesize	that	the	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	cluster	might	modulate	multidrug	resistance	of	cancer	cell	via	inhibit	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	might	modulate	multidrug	resistance	of	cancer	cell	at	least	in	part	by	inhibit	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
these	finding	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	modulates	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	bind	the	3'utr	of	these	gene	
however	when	we	transfected	with	<Protein_Name>	lack	3'utr	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	largely	override	the	<RNA_Name>	anti-apoptosis	function

thus	in	cll	case	we	observe	a	concordant	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	
this	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	do	not	affect	mrna	stability	and	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	the	posttranscriptional	level

take	together	these	study	suggest	a	conserved	function	of	<RNA_Name>	in	vertebrate	in	the	maintenance	of	hematopoietic	stem	cell	population	through	the	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	and	possibly	<Protein_Name>	in	addition	the	involvement	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	hematopoesis	be	likely	conserve	in	avian	specie	
luciferase	reporter	assay	result	show	that	cdk2-associated	cullin	<Number>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	ec	the	result	of	western	blot	and	qrt-pcr	show	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	significantly	increase	in	ec	tissue	compare	with	their	normal	tissue	
it	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	can	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	its	binding	sequence	at	the	5'utr	
then	we	mutate	these	bind	site	by	site-directed	mutagenesis	and	demonstrate	that	mutation	on	the	binding	site	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	successfully	abolish	the	previous	suppressive	effect	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	do	target	<RNA_Name>	by	induce	transcriptional	suppression	rather	than	directly	degrade	<RNA_Name>	rna	transcript

these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	by	target	a	specific	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
these	data	suggest	that	exogenous	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	compromise	the	ability	of	<RNA_Name>	to	promote	cell	growth	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	which	be	consistent	with	its	role	as	a	functional	target	of	the	<RNA_Name>	pathway

<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	and	represses	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	through	3'utr	
moreover	we	provide	evidence	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	capability	to	regulate	two	distinct	but	functionally	convergent	pathway	of	melanocyte	transformation	through	the	cyclin-dependent	kinase	inhibitor	1b	on	one	side	and	c-kit	and	its	downstream	gene	on	the	other	
<RNA_Name>	suppresses	mitochondrial	<Protein_Name>	level	in	hepg2	cell	
previous	study	have	report	that	<Protein_Name>	may	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
demonstrates	that	<RNA_Name>	expression	repress	the	phosphorylation	of	<Protein_Name>	p70s6k	and	4e-bp-1	in	mda-mb-231	cell	but	appear	to	have	no	effect	on	the	total	level	of	these	protein	
generally	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	pathway	be	analogous	to	that	of	sirna	direct	at	<Protein_Name>	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	caki-2	cell	lead	to	downregulation	of	tr-beta1	mrna	and	protein	
transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	precursor	result	in	a	large	induction	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	which	be	follow	by	<Number>	decrease	of	tr-beta1	mrna	expression	and	<Number>	decrease	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	when	compare	with	scramble	control	
electrophoretic	mobility	shift	experiment	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	participates	in	transformation-dependent	deregulation	of	the	c-myc	gene	by	activation	of	two	c-myc	<Protein_Name>	promoter	
finally	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	which	be	find	to	be	decrease	in	gastric	cancer	clinical	specimen	
the	above	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>

the	novel	finding	in	our	study	be	that	<Protein_Name>	be	identify	as	a	target	for	<RNA_Name>	
our	luciferase	reporter	and	western	blotting	assay	demonstrate	that	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	critical	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	be	mirna	that	target	<Protein_Name>	in	colon	cancer	tissue	there	be	an	inverse	correlation	between	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	
apart	from	<Protein_Name>	it	be	identify	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	significantly	downregulated	and	<Protein_Name>	be	upregulated	in	npc	thus	<RNA_Name>	may	be	a	tumor	suppressor	in	npc	and	may	have	a	negative	correlation	with	<Protein_Name>	
after	transfecting	cne-1	and	cne-2	cell	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	or	nc	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	expression	be	determine	through	qrt-pcr	and	western	blot	analysis	respectively

we	also	identify	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	novel	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	the	luciferase	reporter	system	in	this	study	we	evaluate	the	expression	profile	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	different	grade	of	astrocytomas	and	identify	that	<Protein_Name>	as	a	new	target	for	<RNA_Name>	in	astrocytoma	tissue	
these	result	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	directly	
here	we	identify	that	<Protein_Name>	as	a	novel	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	luciferase	reporter	system	and	western	blot	
bioinformatics	analysis	and	luciferase	reporter	assay	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
overexpression	or	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	responsively	alter	both	the	mrna	and	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	its	downstream	gene	matrix	<Protein_Name>	-1	and	-9	in	gastric	cancer	cell	line	sgc-7901	and	mkn-45	
these	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	<Protein_Name>	expression	via	the	bind	site	in	the	3'utr	thus	inhibit	the	invasion	metastasis	and	angiogenesis	of	gastric	cancer	cell	
overall	these	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	considerably	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	posttranscriptional	repression	
<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	two	major	target	gene	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	in	all	the	only	sharp	inverse	relationship	detect	at	early	adult	life	between	<RNA_Name>	and	its	target	<Protein_Name>	be	observe	in	plasma	
<Protein_Name>	be	validate	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	that	be	downregulation	in	crc	
we	show	that	to	acquire	such	proliferation	capacity	<RNA_Name>	target	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	protein	activator	<Number>	which	act	as	a	suppressor	of	<Protein_Name>	function	
moreover	<RNA_Name>	could	not	decrease	the	luciferase	activity	of	mutant	<Protein_Name>	in	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	indicate	<RNA_Name>	target	the	specific	region	on	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
our	result	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
molecular	target	identification	of	these	mirnas	show	that	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	and	purine	nucleoside	phosphorylase	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	be	find	to	regulate	the	target	gene	involve	in	insulin	signal	which	include	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	at	both	the	mrna	and	protein	level	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	myoblasts	inhibit	cell	proliferation	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	myoblasts	attenuate	cell	proliferation	by	suppress	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	phosphorylated	<Protein_Name>	
our	finding	have	highlight	<RNA_Name>	function	in	myogenesis	and	identify	novel	muscle-enriched	target	gene	<Protein_Name>	
direct	interaction	with	<Protein_Name>	be	show	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
we	show	inhibition	of	luciferase	activity	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	but	not	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
the	refolded	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	translatable	but	can	also	bind	the	inhibitory	<Protein_Name>	antisense	rna	
a	coherent	model	predict	that	during	transcription	<Protein_Name>	mrna	must	be	refractory	to	translation	and	antisense	rna	binding	
the	metastable	structure	reduce	the	rate	of	<Protein_Name>	rna	binding	and	completely	block	<Protein_Name>	translation	in	vitro	
<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
in	this	study	we	identify	<RNA_Name>	as	an	mirna	that	target	<Protein_Name>	
we	also	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	osteoblastic	differentiation	in	cooperation	with	<RNA_Name>	which	target	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	inhibits	osteoblast	differentiation	by	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	-34c	cooperatively	inhibit	osteoblast	differentiation	through	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
inactivation	of	<RNA_Name>	stabilizes	<Protein_Name>	mrna	lead	to	repression	of	bmp	signaling	and	abnormal	behavior	of	chondrogenic	progenitor	
in	contrast	ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	duplex	decrease	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	and	as	a	result	derepresses	bmp	signal	and	promotes	cell	apoptosis	
ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	gastric	cancer	cell	line	bgc-823	and	sgc-7901	markedly	inhibit	the	protein	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	remarkably	repress	the	activation	of	<Protein_Name>	kinase	
and	the	result	also	prove	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	gastric	cancer	
together	these	data	indicate	that	both	<Protein_Name>	and	chrdl-1	be	novel	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	apparent	regional	enrichment	of	<RNA_Name>	and	its	target	<Protein_Name>	in	the	cp	would	argue	against	a	strong	posttranscriptional	regulatory	interaction	in	vivo	
thus	under	in	vitro	condition	elevate	<RNA_Name>	level	can	promote	npc	proliferation	in	a	manner	that	can	be	rescue	by	either	chrdl-1	or	<Protein_Name>	co-expression	and	by	enhanced	cell	death	and	enhance	senescence	respectively	
importantly	co-expression	of	either	<Protein_Name>	or	chrdl-1	<Protein_Name>	with	pre-mir-134	be	sufficient	to	rescue	mir-134-	nhibited	cell	migration	suggest	that	both	protein	may	regulate	npc	migration	in	vitro	
these	result	suggest	that	pre-mir-134	modulates	dendritic	maturation	in	response	to	exogenous	bmp-4	application	in	part	through	posttranscriptional	modulation	of	the	bmp	antagonist	chrdl-1	
<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	all	express	at	low	level	in	cl16-mir-155-derived	tumor	than	cl16-ctrl-derived	tumor	
immunocytochemical	staining	of	nm-2c5	and	cl16	cell	show	that	<Protein_Name>	in	contrast	to	cl16	be	not	express	in	nm-2c5	and	<Protein_Name>	show	weak	expression	in	nm-2c5	than	in	cl16	correlate	with	high	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	nm-2c5	
the	lack	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	correlate	with	an	increase	in	<Protein_Name>	synthesis	and	tumorigenicity	
stable	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	<Protein_Name>	subline	reduce	<Protein_Name>	level	<Number>	and	revert	growth	to	organize	polarized	acinus	in	lrecm	gel	in	vitro	motility	and	invasion	assay	suggest	a	decrease	in	tumorigenic	behaviour	confirm	by	reduced	tumor	growth	in	male	athymic	nude	mouse	dependent	on	<RNA_Name>	expression

<RNA_Name>	suppresses	mitochondrial	biogenesis	of	c2c12myocytes	by	target	the	<Number>	'	-utr	of	pgc-1a	mrna	
we	use	<RNA_Name>	as	a	positive	control	which	be	as	assay	by	the	down-regulation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	target	gene	
transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	also	show	significantly	high	troponin	t	expression	because	<RNA_Name>	also	regulate	proliferation	and	differentiation	of	myoblast	cell	by	target	the	transcription	of	<Protein_Name>	
moreover	we	identify	the	cyclin	d1	gene	as	a	novel	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	consistent	with	the	knocked-down	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	cell	growth	and	cell	cycle	progression	in	npc	cell	
furthermore	<Protein_Name>	be	widely	upregulated	in	npc	tumor	and	its	mrna	level	be	inversely	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	expression	
take	together	our	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	might	be	a	tumor	suppressor	in	npc	which	be	exert	partially	by	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	
collectively	these	in	vivo	study	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	downregulate	<Protein_Name>	and	inhibit	the	tumorigenicity	of	cne2	cell	in	nude	mouse	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	cell	
use	western	analysis	we	further	find	that	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	level	be	significantly	reduce	by	<RNA_Name>	transfection	in	hep3b	<RNA_Name>	cl-48	and	hepg2	cell	
take	together	these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	cell	
our	observation	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	may	be	frequently	downregulated	in	hcc	sample	and	the	reduction	may	be	cause	by	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	activate	nf-jb	and	the	activation	be	likely	mediate	by	<Protein_Name>	
therefore	our	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	contributes	to	hepatocarcinogenesis	through	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	demonstrate	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	decreased	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	both	mouse	and	human	hepatocytes	suggest	that	the	mechanism	may	be	conserve	across	these	specie	
it	be	also	interest	to	note	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	largely	at	the	protein	level	
<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	gene	by	interaction	with	the	3-utrs	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	directly	targetrab14	in	nsclc	cell	by	interaction	with	the	3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	
notably	the	tumor	suppressor	effect	of	<Protein_Name>	knockdown	mediate	by	sirna	be	similar	to	those	of	ectopic	<RNA_Name>	expression	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	target	might	be	a	mechanism	of	the	tumor	suppressor	function	of	<RNA_Name>	in	nsclc	cell	
take	together	our	result	show	that	restoration	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	could	partially	rescue	the	tumor	suppressor	function	of	<RNA_Name>	in	nsclc	cell	which	further	show	that	<Protein_Name>	might	be	potentially	involve	in	<Protein_Name>	451-regulated	tumor	suppress	function

<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	in	glioma	cell	by	interaction	with	the	3'-utrs	to	suppress	<Protein_Name>	expression	
luciferase	reporter	assay	confirm	the	ability	of	<RNA_Name>	to	dramatically	suppress	bcl-2	transcription	suggest	that	bcl-2	be	a	targetgene	for	<RNA_Name>	
in	contrast	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	mutant	reporter	in	the	presence	of	phrs-1cla-mir125b	be	almost	unaffected	indicating	that	<RNA_Name>	may	suppress	bcl-2	gene	expression	through	its	binding	sequence	at	the	3'utr	of	bcl-2	
these	data	be	confirm	by	ihc	staining	of	xenograft	tumor	tissue	which	show	that	bcl-2	protein	level	be	inversely	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	expression	
take	together	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	promote	cancer	cell	apoptosis	by	directly	inhibit	the	expression	of	bcl-2	
moreover	bioinformatic	analysis	combine	with	luciferase	reporter	assay	and	western	blot	validate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	this	study	we	characterize	<RNA_Name>	a	novel	down-regulated	mirna	and	investigate	its	effect	on	osteoblast	differentiation	
we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	its	target	propose	a	regulatory	mechanism	in	which	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	control	osteoblast	differentiation	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	suppress	osteogenic	differentiation	of	c2c12	cell	partially	by	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	
murine	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	and	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	respectively	
furthermore	the	expression	level	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	correlate	negatively	with	those	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	target	a	bind	site	of	myosin	va	the	luciferase	reporter	assay	for	mouse	<Protein_Name>	confirm	an	actual	target	site	for	<RNA_Name>	
parallel	to	the	mouse	we	be	able	to	show	that	the	first	binding	site	of	<Protein_Name>	mediate	the	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	myova	3'utr	
a	luciferase	reporter	assay	demonstrate	direct	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	in	mouse	and	human	melanocyte	
<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	the	3-	-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	messenger	rna	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	be	a	novel	and	also	the	first	identify	mirna	that	target	<Protein_Name>	and	the	aberrant	decrease	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	consequent	<Protein_Name>	up-regulation	may	contribute	to	bladder	carcinogenesis	
2b	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	be	strikingly	down-regulated	in	t24	cell	compare	with	that	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	suggest	an	inverse	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	t24	cell	
these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	may	decrease	glucose	uptake	of	bladder	cancer	cell	by	down-regulating	<Protein_Name>	
these	finding	suggest	that	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	or	target	<Protein_Name>	could	serve	as	novel	approach	to	reverse	chemotherapy	resistance	in	breast	cancer	
take	together	these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	subsequently	inhibit	its	expression	
these	target	gene	besides	<Protein_Name>	be	show	to	be	significantly	up-regulated	by	qrt-pcr	assay	which	far	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	could	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
overall	these	result	strongly	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	
therefore	in	the	current	study	<Protein_Name>	be	select	to	investigate	whether	<RNA_Name>	may	target	<Protein_Name>	in	skov3-tr30	cell	
combine	with	luciferase	reporter	assay	the	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	likely	to	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	regulate	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	in	skov-tr30	cell	
luciferase	activity	of	the	3'utr	erk-luc	construct	be	decrease	in	the	presence	of	<RNA_Name>	whereas	luciferase	activity	of	mutate	-luc	construct	be	not	affected	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	modulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	bind	to	erk5-3'utr	
finally	analysis	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	by	immunohistochemistry	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	decrease	in	presence	of	<RNA_Name>	in	lncap	and	c4-2	tumor	
here	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	tumor	suppressor	mirna	<RNA_Name>	via	a	direct	interaction	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	interact	with	<RNA_Name>	and	suppressed	let-7-mediated	gene	regulation	
these	observation	support	the	direct	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	modulate	the	stability	of	<RNA_Name>	and	therefore	have	an	impact	on	its	ability	to	regulate	gene	expression	
together	with	the	above	information	this	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	directly	bind	and	suppress	all	<RNA_Name>	family	member	
the	luciferase	reporter	assay	show	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	binp3l	and	<Protein_Name>	
we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	and	regulate	its	expression	in	escs	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	mouseescs	
<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	escs	by	target	its	3'utr	
we	first	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	mouseescs	
figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	escs	by	target	its	3'utr	
altogether	these	result	indicate	that	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	on	<Protein_Name>	pluripotency	be	mostly	mediate	by	<Protein_Name>	
overexpression	of	the	<Number>	pre-mirs	confirm	the	in	silico	prediction	result	in	a	clear	decrease	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	while	<Protein_Name>	mrna	remain	unaffected	indicating	that	inhibition	of	translation	rather	than	mrna	degradation	be	the	main	mechanism	of	<Protein_Name>	regulation	by	<RNA_Name>	
conversely	the	suppression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	result	in	the	accumulation	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	whereas	its	mrna	be	unchanged	
bioinformatics	analysis	predict	that	the	seed	sequence	of	<RNA_Name>	bind	to	the	3'utr	site	of	<Protein_Name>	at	212-	<Number>	and	345-	<Number>	to	evaluate	the	extent	of	bind	between	<RNA_Name>	and	the	3'utr	region	of	<Protein_Name>	<RNA_Name>	target	reporter	luciferase	reporter	assay	be	perform	by	evaluate	the	luciferase	activity	of	hek-293	cell	transfected	with	pmir-brca1	3'utr	plasmid	and	compare	this	activity	with	that	of	cell	transfected	with	control	plasmid	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	not	at	the	level	of	rna	stability	but	at	its	translation	
the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	translation	and	protein	be	also	evaluate	
in	a	luciferase	assay	in	which	the	3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	include	in	the	pgl3r	vector	<RNA_Name>	but	not	<RNA_Name>	as	control	considerably	reduce	luciferase	activity	
<Protein_Name>	expression	be	down-regulated	in	glomerulus	of	diabetic	mouse	in	addition	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	highly	conserve	in	human	and	mouse	
therefore	we	examine	whether	<Protein_Name>	could	also	be	down-regulated	by	<RNA_Name>	c	under	diabetic	condition	in	mmc	
take	together	we	conclude	that	ebv-encoded	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	t-bet	translation	with	secondary	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	invasive	nasal	nk	t-cell	lymphoma	
interestingly	<Protein_Name>	be	discover	as	a	new	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	and	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	promote	<Protein_Name>	activation	and	membrane	translocation	result	in	cell	apoptosis

take	together	these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	flt-1	and	<Protein_Name>	through	interaction	with	predicted	bind	site	in	their	3'-utrs	
through	biochemical	assay	and	functional	rescue	analysis	we	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	inhibit	e-cadherin	to	induce	a	mesenchymal-like	phenotype	and	promote	the	migration	of	npc	cell	a	
through	bioinformatics	analysis	and	functional	verification	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	repress	e-cadherin

treatment	with	tanshinone	<Protein_Name>	prevent	increased	<Protein_Name>	and	hence	increase	<RNA_Name>	post-mi	whereas	quinidine	do	not	
conclusion	and	implication	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	consequent	recovery	of	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	may	account	partially	for	the	efficacy	of	tanshinone	<Protein_Name>	in	suppress	ischaemic	arrhythmia	and	cardiac	mortality	
hiv-1	<Protein_Name>	element	be	the	target	of	the	viral	transactivating	<Protein_Name>	protein	which	be	express	during	the	course	of	hiv-1	infection	and	know	to	act	at	the	rna	level	to	enhance	viral	gene	expression	by	100-fold	
the	data	suggest	<RNA_Name>	perturbs	melatonin	production	by	promote	destruction	of	the	<Protein_Name>	transcript	
together	these	finding	be	consistent	with	the	conclusion	that	<RNA_Name>	act	early	in	life	to	suppress	melatonin	production	by	promote	degradation	of	<Protein_Name>	transcript	elevation	of	<RNA_Name>	under	pathological	or	physiological	circumstance	might	also	suppress	melatonin	production	
contrary	to	this	hypothesis	in	this	issue	wang	et	al	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	actually	function	as	a	microrna	sponge	to	post-transcriptionally	regulate	the	mrna	of	the	core	transcriptional	factor	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
a	direct	competition	for	<RNA_Name>	binding	occur	between	<RNA_Name>	and	the	mrna	encode	the	core	tfs	and	this	<Protein_Name>	of	war	regulates	hesc	self-renewal	and	differentiation	
the	study	by	wang	et	al	strongly	support	that	<RNA_Name>	act	as	a	microrna	sponge	
<RNA_Name>	modulates	<RNA_Name>	level	a	sits	overexpression	diminish	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	in	self-renewing	hescs	and	drastically	delay	the	increase	in	<RNA_Name>	upon	hesc	differentiation	
we	show	in	a	human	hepatocyte	cell	line	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	expression	of	several	key	lipid-metabolism	gene	include	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	inhibition	also	result	in	significantly	increase	cellular	<Protein_Name>	level

these	data	raise	a	possibility	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	may	be	temporally	and	reciprocally	modulate	by	ecdysone	signal	during	larval	development	where	most	of	the	organismal	growth	occurs

moreover	a	recent	study	identify	that	<RNA_Name>	be	report	to	inhibit	a549	cell	growth	by	target	bcl-2	
gain-	and	loss-of-function	analysis	suggest	that	under	hypoxia	the	increased	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	the	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	expression	and	that	it	may	have	contribute	to	a	reduction	in	estradiol	production	
these	data	suggest	that	the	hypoxia-upregulated	<RNA_Name>	could	repress	<Protein_Name>	expression	via	specific	interaction	with	its	target	site	in	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna

down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	promotes	apoptosis	by	target	<Protein_Name>	in	thyroid	papillary	cancer	
western	blot	analysis	indicate	that	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	the	upregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	at	protein	level	
ectopic	<RNA_Name>	expression	significantly	suppress	the	in	vitro	proliferation	and	colony	formation	of	nsclc	cell	and	enhanced	apoptosis	of	note	ectopic	<RNA_Name>	expression	significantly	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	relate	protein	<Number>	mrna	and	protein	expression	and	reduced	luciferase	reporter	activity	contain	the	<Protein_Name>	3'-untranslated	region	through	the	first	binding	site	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	can	target	zo-1	and	e-cad	mrna	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	<RNA_Name>	target	gene	
transfection	of	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	and	inhibitor	into	hasmcs	significantly	and	dose-dependently	influenced	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	cell	in	all	these	data	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	can	inhibit	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	bind	to	its	3'utr	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	directly	to	putative	tgf-betar1	3'utr	region	as	predicted	
our	study	's	result	be	consistent	with	<RNA_Name>	be	a	candidate	tumor	suppressor	in	neuroblastoma	through	the	direct	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	
to	far	determine	if	mir-16-mediated	enac	expression	be	through	<Protein_Name>	modulation	we	monitor	the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	<RNA_Name>	overexpressed	a549	cell	and	control	post-treated	with	<Number>	or	<Number>	mm	serotonin	
level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	slightly	reduce	in	<RNA_Name>	transfected	a549	cell	post-treated	with	<Number>	mm	serotonin	when	compare	to	control	our	
data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	mediate	upregulation	of	enac	be	independent	of	<Protein_Name>

<RNA_Name>	inhibits	apoptosis	and	repress	<Protein_Name>	in	mouse	cardiomyocytes	
take	together	these	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
among	the	five	mirna	<Protein_Name>	the	only	upregulated	mirna	in	response	to	influenza	infection	correspond	to	<RNA_Name>	table	<Number>	gene	expression	data	for	the	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	target	gene	down-modulated	after	influenza	infection	
furthermore	western	blot	analysis	show	that	over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	the	npc	cell	line	<Protein_Name>	and	5-8f	whereas	block	<RNA_Name>	result	in	upregulation	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	result	support	the	hypothesis	that	<RNA_Name>	executes	an	oncogenic	effect	on	npc	cell	at	least	partly	through	downregulating	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
the	lentivirus-mediated	knockdown	of	<Protein_Name>	reverse	the	effect	of	antogomir-18a	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	affect	the	expression	of	e-cadherin	and	k-ras	through	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
the	direct	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	and	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	and	mir196ab	be	previously	report	
moreover	previous	study	show	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	take	
together	our	data	clearly	demonstrate	that	both	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
accordingly	the	seed	region	of	this	version	of	<RNA_Name>	present	perfect	complementarity	with	its	predict	target	site	region	at	the	3'utr	ofenam	and	<Protein_Name>	
as	show	in	figure	3a	a	statistically	significant	reduction	of	the	luciferase	activity	be	observe	for	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	when	cotransfected	with	the	ancestral	<RNA_Name>	as	compare	with	the	modern	<RNA_Name>	
rather	we	find	that	host	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	could	target	viral	large	protein	and	<Protein_Name>	gene	and	a	lack	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	responsible	for	increased	vsv	replication	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	
to	unveil	the	underlie	mechanism	of	the	disrupted	angiogenesis	mediate	by	<RNA_Name>	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	mcf-7	cell	be	measure	by	western	blot	analysis	the	
result	indicate	that	the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	reduce	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	while	the	suppression	of	<RNA_Name>	reveal	an	opposite	result	under	normoxic	condition	
to	far	investigate	the	underlie	mechanism	the	expression	of	the	transcription	factor	hif-1alpha	which	be	responsible	for	<Protein_Name>	regulation	in	mcf-7	cell	be	examine	through	western	blot	analysis	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	show	that	the	expression	of	hif-1alpha	be	decrease	in	the	mcf-7	cell	after	be	transfected	with	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	correlate	with	decreased	<Protein_Name>	production	
<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	inhibits	angiogenesis	
this	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	transcript	represent	a	genuine	target	of	the	<RNA_Name>	family	
our	data	demonstrate	for	the	first	time	that	the	<RNA_Name>	family	be	able	to	regulate	h2s	production	by	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
as	show	in	figure	2c	all	five	member	of	the	<RNA_Name>	family	have	one	8-bp	conserve	target	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
this	strongly	lead	us	to	believe	that	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	could	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	family	
<RNA_Name>	suppresses	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	both	mrna	and	protein	level	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	promote	mrna	degradation	
in	conclusion	our	study	be	the	first	to	identify	and	validate	<Protein_Name>	as	a	target	of	the	<RNA_Name>	family	and	to	demonstrate	the	role	of	the	<RNA_Name>	family	in	mi	injury	
we	show	that	microrna-128	directly	target	mrna	of	<Protein_Name>	a	key	component	of	<Protein_Name>	in	addition	to	<Protein_Name>	a	component	of	<Protein_Name>	that	we	previously	show	as	a	target	as	well	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	most	effective	when	both	target	site	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	target	
in	fact	here	we	report	that	<RNA_Name>	target	a	component	of	<Protein_Name>	as	well	<Protein_Name>	
thus	<RNA_Name>	may	mediate	some	of	its	effect	on	chemosensitivity	in	kyse450	cell	through	the	negative	regulation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	transcript	
<RNA_Name>	regulate	cardiomyocyte	autophagy	induce	by	hypoxia-reoxygenation	through	lc3-ii	
in	summary	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
analysis	of	manxyz	mrna	stability	and	translation	in	the	presence	and	absence	of	<RNA_Name>	indicate	that	manxyzis	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	under	stress	condition	and	when	<RNA_Name>	be	ectopically	express	
in	vitro	footprinting	and	in	vivo	mutational	analysis	show	that	<RNA_Name>	base	pair	with	manxyz	within	the	<Protein_Name>	cod	sequence	to	prevent	<Protein_Name>	translation	
the	<RNA_Name>	222-mediated	reduction	in	e-cadherin	abundance	depend	on	their	targeting	of	the	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	which	be	a	member	of	the	<Protein_Name>	family	of	transcriptional	repressor	
a	titration	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	reveal	a	down-regulation	of	luciferase	production	for	the	<Protein_Name>	wildtype	3'utr	but	not	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	mutant	construct	confi	rming	that	<Protein_Name>	be	highly	likely	to	be	a	targetfor	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	in	vivo	
we	also	observe	a	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	at	the	protein	level	upon	transfection	of	cell	with	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	
indeed	depletion	of	<Protein_Name>	by	sirna	blunt	the	ability	of	mir-	<Number>	<Number>	expression	and	<Protein_Name>	depletion	to	up-regulate	e-cadherin	expression	
<Protein_Name>	protein	from	mycobacterium	tuberculosis	inhibit	apoptosis	of	macrophage	through	nf-kb-mirna21-bcl-2	pathway	furthermore	the	result	provide	strong	evidence	that	bcl-2	up-regulation	be	positively	control	by	<RNA_Name>	
finally	nf-	b	be	identify	as	the	transcription	factor	for	<RNA_Name>	use	a	chip	assay	
the	data	report	here	be	the	first	to	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	play	an	oncogenic	role	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	modulate	the	malignant	biological	behavior	of	pancreatic	cancer	cell	
these	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	carry	a	putative	binding	site	for	<RNA_Name>	and	can	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
furthermore	the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	panc-1	and	<Protein_Name>	paca-2	cell	may	decrease	<Protein_Name>	level	promote	cell	proliferation	and	migration	
this	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	be	involve	in	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	pathway	by	affect	<Protein_Name>	expression	
furthermore	<Protein_Name>	be	identify	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
knockdown	of	<Protein_Name>	inhibit	gc	cell	malignant	behavior	whereas	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	partially	restore	the	suppression	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	
additionally	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	negatively	correlate	with	<Protein_Name>	in	gc	tissue	
take	together	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	its	3'utr	
this	result	far	support	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
in	loss-of-function	experiment	wild-type	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	expression	be	decrease	by	block	<RNA_Name>	
to	confirm	whether	the	suppressed	proliferation	and	enhance	apoptosis	by	<RNA_Name>	be	associate	with	<Protein_Name>	we	detect	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	by	qrt-pcr	and	western	blotting	respectively	
<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	in	a549	cell	be	significantly	increase	by	either	oligo-mir-125a-5p	mimic	or	pgcsiu6-mir-125a-5p	transfection	
a	microrna	<RNA_Name>	that	repress	kv1	<Number>	mrna	translation	when	mtorc1	be	active	
we	find	upregulated	<RNA_Name>	expression	to	increase	e-cadherin	and	suppress	the	<Protein_Name>	-beta-catenin	pathway	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	ga	thus	delay	tumor	growth	in	vivo	
<Protein_Name>	be	identify	as	a	<RNA_Name>	target	by	microt-v4	
to	confirm	the	bioinformatics-based	prediction	we	perform	western	blot	analysis	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	<RNA_Name>	or	amo-183	transfected	cell	
<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	the	3'utr	
insertion	of	<RNA_Name>	targetsequences	within	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	lead	to	diminish	luciferase	reporter	activity	in	the	presence	of	<RNA_Name>	and	increased	activity	in	the	presence	of	an	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	
force	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	suppress	<Protein_Name>	cell	proliferation	invasion	and	migration	and	promote	cell	apoptosis	by	downregulating	<Protein_Name>	
we	identify	the	smoothened	gene	as	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	find	that	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	counteract	the	chemosensitizing	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	of	gastric	cancer	cell	by	down-regulating	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	result	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	in	gastric	cancer	cell	by	down-regulating	<Protein_Name>	expression	
furthermore	<Protein_Name>	be	reveal	to	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
among	the	three	potential	target	only	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	be	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	in	both	cell	
suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	by	<RNA_Name>	be	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	in	a549	cell	
these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	for	<RNA_Name>	
expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	show	a	significant	inverse	correlation	as	calculate	by	spearman	's	correlation	analysis	
in	contrast	to	downregulation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	targetgenes	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	by	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	nsclc	cell	line	the	intrinsicexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	low	in	sclc	cell	line	and	be	not	influenced	byoverexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	summary	we	demonstrate	that	ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	could	down-regulate	<RNA_Name>	targetgenes	in	cell	express	the	target	
we	observe	an	inverse	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	c-met	but	not	bcl-2	expression	in	<Number>	sclc	cell	line	
transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	precursor	downregulated	mrna	expression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	in	a549	and	nci-h1299	nsclc	cell	by	more	than	<Number>	whereas	the	mrna	expression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	in	nci-h82	and	nci-n592	sclc	cell	be	too	low	to	be	detect	by	real-time	pcr	assay	
intriguingly	all	the	sclc	cell	line	test	in	this	study	express	low	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	two	<RNA_Name>	targetgenes	
mutation	experiment	indicate	that	the	hbl-1	3'utr	be	both	necessary	and	sufficient	to	downregulate	a	reporter	gene	during	development	and	the	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	micrornas	be	both	required	for	hbl-1	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	
also	we	discover	<RNA_Name>	play	a	role	in	osteosarcoma	by	bind	the	3'utr	of	zinc	finger	e-box-binding	homeobox	<Number>	mrna	and	that	overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	could	reverse	the	proliferation	subsequently	block	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	
in	a	direct	test	of	endogenous	target	individual	mirna	inhibition	in	metastatic	lm2	cell	lead	to	an	increase	target-driven	luciferase	activity	that	be	abrogate	upon	mutate	the	mirna	target	sit	reveal	<Protein_Name>	to	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	to	be	directly	target	by	all	three	mirnas	
these	finding	establish	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	direct	target	of	these	mirnas	in	melanoma	
in	agreement	with	this	we	find	a	significant	anti-correlation	between	the	endogenous	level	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	the	aggregate	expression	level	of	the	three	mirnas	across	our	collection	of	parental	and	metastatic	line	
the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	targetgenes	be	significantly	increase	only	in	cell	co-transfected	with	both	anti-mir-204	and	-211	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	contribute	to	cell	proliferation	
cotransfection	experiment	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	's	regulation	of	pressure-induced	cytokine	secretion	depend	on	its	targeting	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	hsaepcs	in	this	study	we	clearly	demonstrate	that	overexpressing	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	target	in	hsaepcs	
since	this	increase	be	not	observe	these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	's	ability	to	regulate	pressure-induced	cytokine	secretion	depend	on	its	modulation	of	both	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	target	
first	we	demonstrate	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	represses	<Protein_Name>	expression	on	both	the	mrna	and	protein	level	in	endothelial	cell	whereas	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	result	in	a	modest	but	significant	upregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
confirm	our	finding	the	bind	site	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	characterize	and	experimentally	verify	by	another	group	during	the	course	of	our	study	<Number>	
next	we	investigate	the	functional	role	of	<Protein_Name>	in	<RNA_Name>	signaling	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	not	only	in	vitro	but	also	in	vivo	in	summary	we	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	vascular	cell	and	that	it	convey	its	effect	on	cell	proliferation	in	addition	the	stimulatory	effect	of	antagomir	therapy	be	abolish	by	simultaneous	rapamycin	treatment	demonstrate	that	the	therapeutic	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	in	hind-limb	ischemia	be	dependent	on	the	intact	signal	ability	of	its	target	gene	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	these	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	enhances	vascularization	involve	the	upregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	vivo	
moreover	the	result	show	that	pre-mir-143	significantly	reverse	the	upregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	shikonin	treat	gscs	furthermore	
our	result	identify	that	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	could	markedly	attenuate	the	enhanced	cytotoxic	effect	on	cell	viability	and	induction	of	apoptosis	by	pre-mir-143	in	shikonin	treat	gscs	
<RNA_Name>	enhance	the	tumor	suppressive	effect	of	shikonin	partly	through	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	gscs	
<Protein_Name>	overexpression	significantly	abolish	the	enhanced	apoptosis	induce	by	pre-mir-143	in	shikonin	treat	gscs	
we	describe	anovulation	and	infertility	in	female	mouse	lack	the	micrornas	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
give	that	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	in	the	pituitary	be	not	alter	by	deficiency	in	these	mirnas	the	amount	of	<Protein_Name>	must	be	regulate	by	a	posttranscriptional	mechanism	
moreover	the	increase	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	mir-dko	mouse	be	decrease	to	near	the	wild-type	level	in	the	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	transgenic	mouse	line	
expression	of	<Protein_Name>	know	to	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	be	about	fourfold	increase	follow	injection	of	anti-mir-214	in	contrast	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	tooth	germ	treat	with	anti-mir-214	be	significantly	increase	by	<Number>	<Number>	and	<Number>	<Number>	respectively	
a	luciferase	reporter	assay	far	confirm	that	bcl-2	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	decrease	the	level	of	the	bcl-2	protein	in	cisplatin-resistant	glioma	cell	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	could	downregulate	the	expression	of	bcl-2	by	directly	target	the	bcl-2	3'utr

together	our	data	conclusively	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	pancreatic	-beta-cells	
far	a	moderate	reduction	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	detect	in	pre-mir-30d	transfected	cell	indicate	that	the	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	be	mediate	via	both	translational	repression	and	mrna	instability	
this	be	likely	due	to	the	low	level	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	in	min6	cell	and	anti-mir-30d	only	slightly	reduce	the	<RNA_Name>	level	which	have	little	effect	on	the	map4k4-wt	reporter	activity	
the	identification	of	<Protein_Name>	as	one	of	<RNA_Name>	target	describe	an	important	role	for	<RNA_Name>	in	protect	-beta-cell	function	against	the	inhibitory	action	of	tnf-alpha

significant	inverse	correlation	be	demonstrate	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
furthermore	the	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	and	the	mrna	level	of	its	targetgene	<Protein_Name>	be	examine	
these	result	suggest	that	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	may	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	the	present	study	we	examine	the	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	and	demonstrate	a	significant	inverse	correlation	
additionally	one	target	of	<RNA_Name>	be	show	to	be	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	rs28599926	polymorphism	might	modify	<Protein_Name>	expression	
to	investigate	whether	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	rs28599926	polymorphism	affect	the	expression	of	this	gene	western	blot	analysis	be	accomplish	and	prove	that	mir-1268a-wt	can	down-regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression

under	this	condition	<RNA_Name>	mimic	and	<RNA_Name>	mimic	reduce	<Protein_Name>	mrna	to	-68	and	-48	of	the	endogenous	level	respectively	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	more	potent	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	in	comparison	with	<RNA_Name>	
to	far	confirm	the	direct	association	of	<RNA_Name>	with	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	the	predict	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	the	human	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	clone	into	a	luciferase	reporter	vector

importantly	<RNA_Name>	do	not	repress	a	vector	contain	a	mutate	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	
these	result	demonstrate	that	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	in	pasmc	and	play	a	critical	role	in	contractile	gene	expression	level	
direct	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	far	confirm	by	a	firefly	luciferase	assay	
<Protein_Name>	be	down-regulated	at	both	the	transcript	and	protein	level	upon	<RNA_Name>	over-expression	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	and	we	confirm	the	direct	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	use	a	luciferase	assay	
<RNA_Name>	over-expressing	cell	exhibit	an	aggressive	phenotype	however	they	be	also	more	sensitive	to	dna-damaging	agent	due	to	the	direct	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
high	endogenous	level	of	<RNA_Name>	in	eacs	be	significantly	associate	with	low	<Protein_Name>	level	and	those	patient	might	benefit	more	from	treatment	with	dna-damaging	agent	
to	understand	posttranscriptional	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	role	of	micrornas	in	drug	disposition	we	find	that	microrna-328	might	readily	target	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	when	consider	target-site	accessibility	
we	then	note	an	inverse	relation	between	the	level	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	mcf-7	and	mcf-7	mx100	breast	cancer	cell	and	the	fact	that	<RNA_Name>	level	could	be	rescue	in	mcf-7	mx100	cell	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	plasmid	
luciferase	reporter	assay	show	that	<Protein_Name>	3'utr-luciferase	activity	be	decrease	over	<Number>	in	mcf-7	mx100	cell	after	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	plasmid	the	activity	be	increase	over	<Number>	in	mcf-7	cell	transfected	with	a	<RNA_Name>	antagomir	and	disruption	of	<RNA_Name>	response	element	within	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	lead	to	a	3-fold	increase	in	luciferase	activity	
furthermore	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	down-regulated	when	<RNA_Name>	be	over-expressed	and	the	level	be	up-regulated	when	<RNA_Name>	be	inhibit	by	selective	antagomir	
lastly	mir-328-directed	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	mcf-7	mx100	cell	result	in	an	increased	mitoxantrone	sensitivity	as	manifest	by	a	significantly	low	ic50	value	when	compare	to	the	control	
together	these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	consequently	control	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	and	influence	drug	disposition	in	human	breast	cancer	cell	
alter	<RNA_Name>	and	hif-1alpha	expression	in	liver	confirms	hcc	in	mouse	
alter	liver	<RNA_Name>	and	hif-1alpha	correlate	with	hcc	in	mouse	
n	liver	with	tumor	loss	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	with	a	significant	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	target	hif-1alpha	be	see	
microrna-124-mediated	regulation	of	inhibitory	member	of	apoptosis-stimulating	protein	of	<Protein_Name>	family	in	experimental	stroke	infusion	of	<RNA_Name>	decrease	brain	level	of	<Protein_Name>	whereas	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	enhance	<Protein_Name>	level	and	significantly	reduce	infarction	in	mouse	focal	cerebral	ischemia	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	may	be	a	potent	tumor	suppressor	by	alter	global	chromatin	structure	through	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	to	make	a	clear	comparison	we	plot	<RNA_Name>	rt-qpcr	data	from	<Number>	individual	patient	sample	from	<Protein_Name>	1b	above	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	that	be	obtain	by	rt-qpcr	
our	result	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	up-regulated	in	the	tumor	sample	relative	to	the	adjacent	normal	specimen	whereas	<RNA_Name>	be	down-regulated	in	these	same	sample	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	represses	<Protein_Name>	by	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	in	a	direct	and	sequence	specific	manner	
we	show	that	proto-oncogene	<Protein_Name>	kinase	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	kinase	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	
we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	kinase	at	protein	level	by	directly	bind	to	its	3'utr	complimentary	sequence	
the	rensp	luciferase	level	measure	by	luminometer	show	that	<RNA_Name>	mimic	bind	with	<Protein_Name>	in	a	dose-dependent	manner	far	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	present	study	we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	at	the	posttranscriptional	level	through	a	specific	target	site	within	the	3'utr	
we	reason	that	<RNA_Name>	could	downregulate	mrtf-a	expression	by	target	its	3'utr	in	thyroid	cancer	and	that	mrtf-a	be	overexpressed	in	thyroid	cancer	due	to	lack	of	<RNA_Name>	
all	the	data	illustrate	that	<RNA_Name>	degrade	<Protein_Name>	by	target	the	specific	sit	predict	in	silico	in	anaplastic	thyroid	cancer	cell	
thus	we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	migration	and	invasion	via	degrade	mrtf-a	expression	
<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3-	utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
<RNA_Name>	be	locate	on	chromosome	14q32	a	region	that	be	involve	in	several	type	of	translocation	in	hematological	malignancy	and	delete	by	<Protein_Name>	in	solid	tumor	
significantly	<RNA_Name>	induces	cell	survival	and	cisplatin	resistance	through	target	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	the	<Protein_Name>	which	lead	to	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	activation	of	<Protein_Name>	pathway	
immunoblotting	and	rt-pcr	analysis	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	protein	but	not	mrna	be	considerably	decrease	in	mir-214-ransfected	hiose-80	cell	in	contrast	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	by	2'-o-me	<RNA_Name>	in	a2780cp	cell	which	express	high	level	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	increase	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	
far	the	phosphorylation	level	of	<Protein_Name>	a	major	target	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	substrate	glycogen	synthase	kinase	<Number>	'	and	p70s6k	be	elevate	by	ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	decrease	by	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	pathway	
inverse	correlation	of	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	investigate	in	primary	ovarian	tumor	specimen	of	the	<Number>	primary	ovarian	tumor	examine	<Number>	exhibited	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Number>	have	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	
among	<Number>	tumor	with	elevated	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	have	decrease	<Protein_Name>	level	
these	data	far	support	the	finding	that	the	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
finally	luciferase	activity	assay	show	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	its	<Number>	'	-utr	
use	gain	and	loss	of	function	experiment	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	modulates	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	level	in	endothelial	cell	
the	result	of	this	study	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	control	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	level	in	endothelial	cell	
furthermore	luciferase	assay	with	wt	and	mutate	3'utr-binding	site	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
remarkably	we	find	that	the	core	binding	factor	cbf-beta	have	the	most	reduced	activity	and	the	predicted	binding	site	be	conserve	among	specie	suggest	that	cbf-beta	be	likely	to	be	the	most	important	targetregulated	by	<RNA_Name>	
altogether	these	data	demonstrate	that	cbf-beta	may	be	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	the	putative	binding	site	be	critical	for	mir-125b-mediated	regulation	of	cbf-beta	expression	
these	data	indicate	that	cbf-beta	be	an	important	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	malignant	myeloid	cell	
take	together	these	result	demonstrate	that	down-regulated	cbf-beta	by	<RNA_Name>	be	associate	with	the	hematopoietic	malignancy	
we	observe	a	dramatic	reduction	in	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	upon	ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	
next	we	clone	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	into	a	luciferase	reporter	and	find	that	<RNA_Name>	repress	reporter	activity	by	more	than	6-fold	again	consistent	with	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
importantly	mutation	of	the	four	candidate	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	abrogate	<RNA_Name>	repression	and	a	mutant	<RNA_Name>	construct	design	to	be	complementary	to	the	mutant	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	binding	site	restore	mir-150-mediated	repression	but	do	not	affect	the	wild-type	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
these	experiment	establish	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	directly	through	its	3'utr	
together	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
collectively	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	dc	maturation	at	least	in	part	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
the	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	confirm	by	dual	luciferase	assay	
<Protein_Name>	be	the	targeted	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	present	study	<Protein_Name>	be	the	targeted	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
6b	overexpressing	<RNA_Name>	significantly	suppress	<Protein_Name>	level	in	glioblastoma	cell	meanwhile	silence	<RNA_Name>	increase	<Protein_Name>	expression	
as	we	expect	the	expression	level	of	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	downregulated	in	the	nickel-induced	tumor	
we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	may	promote	cell	proliferation	infinitely	during	nickel-induced	tumorigenesis	in	part	by	regulate	the	expression	of	its	target	gene	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
our	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	and	cdknic	as	the	bona	fide	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	may	have	a	high	correlation	with	the	nickel-induce	tumorigenesis	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	its	target	gene	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	may	play	a	role	in	the	progress	of	the	nickel-induced	tumorigenesis	
by	western	blot	analysis	down-regulations	of	caspase	<Number>	be	observe	in	<RNA_Name>	transfectants	
result	support	an	idea	that	the	protective	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	doxorubicin-induced	apoptosis	in	a431	cell	may	be	relate	to	its	effect	on	the	down-regulation	of	caspase	<Number>	rather	than	on	the	process	of	drug-induced	caspase	<Number>	activation	
as	a	control	we	also	monitor	the	level	of	the	previously	report	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	use	an	antibody	that	recognize	both	n-ras	and	k-ras	and	an	antibody	to	n-ras	
under	both	the	asynchronous	and	the	synchronous	protocol	<RNA_Name>	transfection	lead	to	a	large	and	more	rapid	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	level	than	in	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
we	thus	conclude	at	this	stage	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	thus	impair	its	expression	
this	provide	additional	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	in	<RNA_Name>	of	interest	we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	be	an	additional	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	also	find	that	<Protein_Name>	be	widely	over-expressed	and	inversely	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	in	clinical	specimen	
take	together	our	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	play	a	role	of	<Protein_Name>	inglioblastoma	at	least	in	part	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	all	these	result	strongly	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	gbm	cell	
<RNA_Name>	decrease	cell	growth	and	drug	resistance	by	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	
we	identify	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	analyze	combine	result	from	in	silico	search	and	global	expression	array	of	the	same	rna	sample	
moreover	immunoblot	assay	show	that	<RNA_Name>	reduce	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	significantly	which	be	a	classical	emt	inducer	in	breast	cancer	
these	result	indicate	that	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	can	simultaneously	suppress	the	invasiveness	and	promote	apoptosis	of	lung	cancer	cell	a549	and	h1299	by	target	bcl-w	and	<Protein_Name>	
confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	of	synthetic	<RNA_Name>	significantly	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	expression	level	in	l929	cell	
downregulated	<RNA_Name>	and	upregulated	<Protein_Name>	be	confirm	in	the	b	cell	of	an	imiquimod-induced	lupus-like	model	
to	determine	whether	the	<RNA_Name>	bindsg	site	on	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	functional	we	cotransfected	a	plasmid	that	express	the	renilla	luciferase	gene	under	the	control	of	the	cytomegalovirus	promoter	with	the	3'utr	region	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	that	contain	the	putative	<RNA_Name>	bindsg	site	and	pre-mir-519d	
these	data	be	compatible	with	a	functional	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	thereby	suggest	that	change	in	<RNA_Name>	level	may	modulate	the	expression	of	gene	regulate	by	this	transcription	factor	
more	importantly	we	provide	evidence	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	and	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	have	the	high	fold	change	in	both	cell	line	upon	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	and	<Protein_Name>	have	the	second	high	fold	change	in	ftc-133	cell	which	be	use	for	both	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	assay	in	the	present	study	
both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	play	important	role	in	several	cancer	and	have	be	show	to	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	reduce	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	in	tpc-1	and	xtc-1	cell	and	reduced	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	in	all	three	cell	line	
we	also	find	that	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	downregulated	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	in	ftc-133-luc2	tumor	xenograft	that	have	be	inoculate	subcutaneously	into	the	flank	of	athymic	nude	mouse	and	allow	to	develop	for	<Number>	day	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	significantly	decrease	luciferase	activity	as	compare	to	the	negative	control	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	3'utr	region	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	thyroid	cancer	cell	
we	next	analyze	whether	there	be	an	association	between	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	in	the	tcga	papillary	thyroid	cancer	dataset	and	find	a	significant	inverse	association	with	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	but	not	with	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	
<RNA_Name>	could	bind	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	regulate	its	expression	level	
the	bioinformatics	method	be	use	to	predict	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	suggeseted	that	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	bind	to	<RNA_Name>	the	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	have	a	negative	regulatory	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	both	a549	and	<Protein_Name>	cell	line	
these	data	agree	with	our	previous	hypothesis	that	<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	the	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	and	it	could	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	bind	its	3'utr	in	nsclc	cell	line	
we	find	that	restoration	of	<RNA_Name>	down-regulated	the	proliferative	marker	of	dihydrofolate	reductase	and	proliferate	cell	nuclear	antigen	and	apoptotic	regulator	of	bcl-2	
these	result	suggest	posttranscriptional	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	by	anti-mir-221	
plc-beta1	be	one	of	the	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	the	dual	luciferase	report	system	demonstrate	that	plc-beta1	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	cell	
this	indicate	that	plc-beta1	may	be	one	of	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	tumor	
these	data	suggest	that	the	over-expression	of	plc-beta1	be	associate	with	a	loss	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	promotes	stemness	of	hcc	by	target	plc-beta1	and	increase	<Protein_Name>	expression	
furthermore	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	level	be	increase	in	pdcd4-negative	tumor	and	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	may	be	down-regulated	in	oscc	by	direct	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	to	the	3'utr	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	oral	carcinoma	cell	
<RNA_Name>	be	upregulated	by	oxidative	stress	and	induces	endothelial	cell	apoptosis	and	senescence	via	<Protein_Name>	inhibition	
transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	a	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	by	<Number>	whereas	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	downregulated	<Protein_Name>	mrna	by	<Number>	
co-transfection	of	the	two	micrornas	do	not	alter	<Protein_Name>	mrna	downregulation	to	level	see	with	<RNA_Name>	alone	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	highly	efficient	in	mediate	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	and	that	the	less-efficient	<RNA_Name>	do	not	compete	with	<RNA_Name>	in	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	
therefore	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	be	primarily	mediate	by	<RNA_Name>	similarly	to	connexin43	
in	addition	we	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	treatment	lead	to	a	significant	reduction	in	the	expression	of	the	liver-specific	<RNA_Name>	an	mirna	that	have	be	previously	show	to	be	essential	for	hcv	replication	
either	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	or	overexpression	of	its	target	<Protein_Name>	in	glioblastoma-derived	cell	line	lead	to	decreased	proliferation	increase	apoptosis	and	decreased	colony	formation	in	soft	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	to	regulate	mammary	carcinoma	cell	migration	and	invasion	
consistently	force	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	diminished	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	both	mrna	and	protein	level	indicate	<Protein_Name>	be	a	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
similarly	we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	map	the	major	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	within	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
we	show	that	sirna-mediated	depletion	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	significantly	abrogate	the	enhanced	migration	and	invasion	consequent	to	<RNA_Name>	depletion	
thus	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	play	important	role	downstream	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	repress	its	expression	
these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	downregulated	in	human	gastric	cancer	tissue	and	there	be	an	inverse	correlation	between	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	level	in	cultured	gastric	cancer	cell	after	<Protein_Name>	stimulation	
take	together	these	data	provide	strong	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	target	<Protein_Name>	and	repress	its	expression	in	gastric	cancer	cell	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	gastric	cancer	cell	migration	and	invasion	in	vitro	by	repress	<Protein_Name>	expression	
<Protein_Name>	overexpression	vector	lack	3'utr	together	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	transfection	strongly	abrogate	mir-370-induced	cell	proliferation	and	the	formation	of	capillary-like	structure	in	huvecs	
take	together	our	result	reveal	that	the	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	might	facilitate	the	repair	of	amputated	finger	by	regulate	angiogenesis	through	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	result	present	that	antagonism	of	<RNA_Name>	increase	the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	the	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	and	far	result	in	the	activation	of	the	notch-apoptosis	pathway	in	tumor	cell	
a	significant	inverse	correlation	be	find	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	invasive	breast	cancer	5a	implicate	<Protein_Name>	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	breast	cancer	
since	our	data	suggest	a	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	gc	cell	we	check	whether	<RNA_Name>	may	target	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
our	data	show	that	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	sequence	3'utr	range	from	351th	base	site	to	358th	base	site	
<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	functionally	important	for	the	biological	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	
accordingly	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	reduce	in	pd	brain	sample	display	strong	<RNA_Name>	c	downregulation	
our	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	and	dj-1	be	indirect	target	of	<RNA_Name>	c	
these	finding	suggest	that	mitochondrial	dysfunction	link	to	<RNA_Name>	c	downregulation	may	involve	at	least	in	part	a	decreased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
our	result	demonstrate	the	novel	mechanism	control	<Protein_Name>	expression	via	<RNA_Name>	in	e	cell	
although	<RNA_Name>	might	influence	the	expression	of	many	gene	we	focus	on	<Protein_Name>	mrna	as	a	<RNA_Name>	target	in	es	cell	
furthermore	sequence	analysis	suggest	possible	association	of	<RNA_Name>	with	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
the	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	the	cell	line	sosp-9607	induces	apoptosis	and	cell	cycle	arrest

when	<RNA_Name>	be	up-regulated	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	pathway	be	both	inactivate	
more	importantly	when	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	inactivate	by	the	inhibitor	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	remedied	the	inactivation	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	<RNA_Name>	target	in	silico	analysis	show	high	score	and	a	low	mean	free	energy	for	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	interaction	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	robust	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	confirm	the	mir-targetrelationship	experimentally	use	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	luciferase	vector	assay	by	challenge	with	premir-29c	
the	<RNA_Name>	seed	sequence	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	
these	result	suggest	that	ts23	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	the	natural	near	complementarity	of	ts23	to	<RNA_Name>	be	necessary	for	mir-23-	mediated	post-transcriptional	silencing	of	gene	expression	
this	observation	suggest	that	the	function	of	<RNA_Name>	have	be	conserve	phylogenetically	as	a	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	in	human	and	mouse	
these	result	far	suggest	that	synthetic	<RNA_Name>	might	suppress	the	expression	of	the	gene	for	<Protein_Name>	at	the	translational	level	
<RNA_Name>	<Number>	targetedapk	and	<Protein_Name>	in	crc	cell	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	reduce	the	activity	of	<Protein_Name>	and	klf4-based	reporter	whereas	antagomir-103	<Number>	markedly	increase	the	activity	of	<Number>	reporter	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	by	target	their	3'-utrs	
these	data	support	that	<RNA_Name>	107-dependent	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	associate	with	metastasis	and	poor	prognosis	of	patient	with	crc	
the	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	and	-222	which	be	abnormally	express	in	melanoma	and	favor	the	induction	of	the	malignant	phenotype	by	downregulating	c-kit	receptor	and	<Protein_Name>	might	in	the	future	represent	an	efficient	treatment	for	translation	into	the	clinical	setting	
we	further	show	that	<Protein_Name>	mcp-2	be	a	target	for	<RNA_Name>	in	hiv-1	infected	microglia	as	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	prevented	hiv-induced	secretion	of	mcp-2	chemokine

further	study	show	that	<RNA_Name>	could	directly	targetthe	3'-untranslated	region	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	suppress	their	mrna	and	protein	expression	
conversely	when	we	perform	luciferase	assay	use	a	plasmid	harbour	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	which	the	binding	site	for	<RNA_Name>	be	inactivate	by	site-directed	mutant	<Protein_Name>	the	luciferase	activity	of	mutant	reporter	be	unaffected	by	the	simultaneous	infection	of	<RNA_Name>	
meanwhile	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	also	substantially	decrease	after	ectopic	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	lm9	and	hepg2	cell	line	as	evidence	by	western	blot	assay	
collectively	these	data	support	the	bioinformatics	prediction	indicate	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	3'-utrs	as	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	result	provide	evidence	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	involve	in	mir-124-regulated	hcc	cell	invasiveness	and	metastasis	
further-more	we	find	that	overexpression	of	mir-372suppressed	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	the	cell	
our	dataobtained	from	gain-of-function	approach	conmmed	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>

<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	involve	in	regulate	cell	fate	with	increased	<RNA_Name>	and	or	decrease	mir-133levels	favor	apoptosis	and	decrease	<RNA_Name>	and	or	<RNA_Name>	level	favor	survival	
post-transcriptional	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	and	of	caspase-9	by	<RNA_Name>	contributes	significantly	to	their	opposing	action	
<RNA_Name>	transfected	myeloma	cell	be	arrest	in	g1	s	checkpoint	and	secrete	less	<Protein_Name>	compare	to	control	transfected	cell	although	no	significant	difference	be	find	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	the	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	mcf-7	cell	and	conversely	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	in	mcf7tr	cell	result	in	increased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
the	dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	verify	that	that	<RNA_Name>	combine	with	the	3-	-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	
our	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	significantly	decrease	the	relative	luciferase	activity	of	the	wild-type	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	compare	with	the	mutant	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	indicating	that	<RNA_Name>	may	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
therefore	we	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	increase	cell	sensitivity	of	ovarian	cancer	cell	line	to	paclitaxel	and	cisplatin	by	target	<Protein_Name>	but	not	<Protein_Name>	
base	on	these	finding	and	our	study	result	we	consider	that	<RNA_Name>	may	inhibit	the	development	of	drug	resistance	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	regulate	gst-	expression	in	ovarian	cancer	cell	
briefly	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression15	
<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	reduce	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	have	similar	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
similarly	<RNA_Name>	affect	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	to	a	less	extent	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	but	not	mouse	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	be	a	strong	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	the	<Protein_Name>	e3	ligase28	<Number>	and	accordingly	we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	level	be	increase	in	mouse	leukemias	express	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	both	of	which	target	<Protein_Name>	
there	be	cell-line-	pecific	difference	and	in	koptk1	cell	which	express	high	level	of	<RNA_Name>	an	antagomir	against	<RNA_Name>	restores	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	
this	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	maintains	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	repression	in	koptk1	cell	but	not	in	tall-1	cell	
similarly	co-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	produce	additive	effect	on	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	activity	respectively	
it	have	previously	be	show	that	<RNA_Name>	be	directly	regulate	by	<Protein_Name>	and	target	bcl-2	
moreover	bcl-2	be	downregulated	by	<RNA_Name>	in	cell	line	which	might	be	in	line	with	their	possible	role	in	cll	pathogenesis	
thus	forkhead	box	f2	be	identify	as	a	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	in	conclusion	<RNA_Name>	be	a	novel	prognostic	predictor	for	hcc	patient	and	it	may	potentiate	proliferation	and	inhibits	apoptosis	of	hcc	cell	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	
in	the	present	study	we	find	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	cyclin	e	expression	by	target	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	of	cyclin	e	messenger	rna	in	escc	cell	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	cyclin	e	mrna	at	3'utr	and	impairs	cyclin	e	mrna	translation	
these	result	provide	further	evidence	to	demonstrate	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	regulate	cyclin	e	expression	in	escc	cell	
these	result	suggest	that	in	escc	cell	<RNA_Name>	have	the	potential	of	regulate	g1	to	s	cell	cycle	progression	and	cyclin	e	play	a	key	role	in	this	effect	
the	authers	report	that	the	conserved	<RNA_Name>	rna	downregulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	complementary	interaction	with	the	translational	initiation	region	of	<Protein_Name>	message	cause	them	to	be	degrade	<Protein_Name>	
bind	efficiently	to	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	be	essential	for	in	vivo	stability	of	the	srna	as	well	as	for	micm-mediated	decay	of	the	<Protein_Name>	message	in	vitro	
<RNA_Name>	be	a	potential	mirna	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
it	be	verify	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	new	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	in	summary	we	examine	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	sepsis	
<Protein_Name>	be	predict	as	the	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	by	targetscan	and	verify	the	predict	result	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	in	a	seed	sequence-dependent	manner	
we	validate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	for	<RNA_Name>	with	a	luciferase	reporter	activity	assay	
furthermore	<RNA_Name>	be	identify	and	characterize	to	interact	with	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	thereby	<RNA_Name>	antagomir	be	capable	of	upregulating	<Protein_Name>	expression	that	might	protect	neuron	from	ischemia-induced	cell	death	
collectively	these	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
this	be	consistent	with	the	idea	that	an	ischemia-induced	reduction	in	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	expressionand	function	of	p-gp	through	the	repression	of	mrna	by	direct	interaction	on	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	the	present	study	we	focus	on	the	decreased	<RNA_Name>	in	the	small	intestine	after	liver	i	r	because	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	as	well	as	mdr1a	mrna	have	a	potential	<RNA_Name>	target	site	as	predict	by	in	silico	analysis	the	result	from	the	luciferase	assay	use	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	plasmid	in	hek293	cell	and	the	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	in	caco-2	cell	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	expression	and	function	of	p-gp	through	the	repression	of	mrna	by	direct	action	on	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
therefore	it	be	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	expression	and	function	of	p-gp	through	the	translational	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
after	show	that	<Protein_Name>	up-regulated	<RNA_Name>	and	that	<RNA_Name>	mediates	at	least	some	figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	high	in	bm	stem	cell	pools	<RNA_Name>	be	downstream	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	pu	<Number>	
functionality	we	use	the	available	prediction	program	to	identify	pu	<Number>	as	a	putative	target	for	<RNA_Name>	
to	test	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	pu	<Number>	expression	we	generate	a	retroviral	vector	that	express	a	<RNA_Name>	hairpin	precursor	
although	this	vector	produce	an	600-fold	increase	in	<RNA_Name>	in	293t	cell	<RNA_Name>	expression	increase	only	8-fold	follow	viral	infection	of	wild-type	bm	cell	
infection	of	either	wild-type	or	hoxa9-deficient	bm	cell	with	this	<RNA_Name>	expression	vector	result	in	an	<Number>	decrease	in	pu	<Number>	protein	a	finding	that	have	be	report	by	others	since	the	inception	of	this	work	
these	finding	strongly	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	might	regulate	pu	<Number>	via	<RNA_Name>	and	that	this	might	be	a	significant	window	into	understand	how	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	influence	hematopoiesis	
online	software	be	use	to	identify	<Protein_Name>	mrna	as	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	direct	interaction	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	investigate	use	a	biotinylated	<RNA_Name>	pull-down	assay	
overexpression	of	a	<RNA_Name>	precursor	lower	cellular	level	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	conversely	antagonism	of	<RNA_Name>	enhance	<Protein_Name>	translation	without	disturb	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	
a	luciferase	reporter	assay	reveal	a	repressive	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	via	a	single	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	target	site	and	point	mutation	of	this	site	prevent	mir-195-induced	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	translation	
luciferase	activity	be	significantly	decrease	by	the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	but	not	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	down-regulate	the	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	different	mechanism	i	e	mrna	degradation	and	translational	repression	respectively	
these	result	support	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	down-regulate	the	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	recognize	the	element	in	the	coding	region	and	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	respectively	
this	be	accompany	by	increase	of	the	mature	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	level	
it	be	consider	that	pma	or	h2o2	repress	the	<Protein_Name>	expression	though	increase	the	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	level	
take	together	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	inhibit	proliferation	of	saos-2	cell	by	target	<Protein_Name>

here	we	show	that	both	simvastatin	and	atorvastatin	induce	hepatic	<RNA_Name>	expression	while	at	the	same	time	decrease	the	mrna	level	of	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	cpt1alpha	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
we	then	investigate	the	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
luciferase	reporter	assay	demonstrate	that	co-transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	mimic	decrease	the	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	its	3'utr	activity	while	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	increase	these	level	which	suggest	<Protein_Name>	be	a	potential	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
alteration	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	lead	to	the	regulation	in	3'utr	activity	of	<Protein_Name>	in	hl-1	cell	
experimental	emt	in	vitro	assay	be	perform	as	previously	describe	and	qrt-pcr	analysis	demonstrate	that	most	of	these	novel	candidate	gene	be	down-regulated	after	overexpression	of	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	avc	explants	respectively	
two	gene	be	downregulated	only	when	overexpressed	with	<RNA_Name>	while	<Protein_Name>	be	up-regulated	after	overexpression	of	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	respectively	
therefore	we	have	identify	<Number>	new	gene	modulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	that	may	be	involve	in	the	emt	process	
both	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	silencing	of	<RNA_Name>	with	antagomirs	significantly	decrease	<RNA_Name>	level	and	increase	the	level	of	a	functionally	important	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
importantly	the	level	of	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	express	in	the	primary	tumor	be	markedly	increase	by	antagomir-10b	treatment

collectively	our	data	show	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	modulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	bind	to	its	3'utr	
to	initially	explore	the	mechanism	by	which	14-3-3delta	be	down-regulated	in	<Protein_Name>	bifida	we	measure	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	normal	and	defective	spinal	cord	at	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	subgroup	<Number>	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	similar	to	that	in	control

we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	interaction	with	bs1	and	<Protein_Name>	
combine	with	our	substantial	evidence	on	<RNA_Name>	inversely	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	we	propose	that	mir-204-regulation	of	migration	of	eec	cell	be	mediate	to	a	large	extent	through	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>

therefore	<Protein_Name>	and	downstream	<RNA_Name>	may	be	new	negative	regulator	for	dc	cross-priming	by	suppress	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	il-12p70	production	
to	verify	whether	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	we	construct	a	reporter	plasmid	contain	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	find	that	its	expression	be	inhibit	by	<RNA_Name>	cotransfection	whereas	the	seed	region-mutated	construct	fail	to	be	inhibit	by	<RNA_Name>	expression

together	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	modulates	the	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	via	bind	site	in	its	3'utr	and	promote	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	in	<Protein_Name>	and	c-33a	cell	
western	blot	and	3'utr	reporter	assay	confirm	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hmscs	
a	western	blot	analysis	of	<Protein_Name>	demonstrate	that	its	protein	level	be	reduce	in	hmscs	by	<RNA_Name>	exogenous	overexpression	
to	determine	whether	<RNA_Name>	directly	modulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	level	in	hmscs	we	clone	the	full-length	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	downstream	of	the	renilla	luciferase	gene	as	a	reporter	and	assay	its	expression	in	hmscs	transfected	with	a	synthetic	precursor	or	a	specific	inhibitor	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	control	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	hmscs	by	direct	binding	to	its	3'utr	
the	result	of	these	experiment	show	a	significant	reduction	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	level	in	the	cell	transduce	with	the	lentiviral	vector	encode	<RNA_Name>	compare	with	those	transduce	with	a	control	lentiviral	vector	which	be	in	good	agreement	with	the	rest	of	the	data	indicating	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hmscs	
a	3'utr	reporter	assay	in	hek-293t	cell	also	show	that	among	these	three	putative	target	only	the	<Protein_Name>	reporter	be	significantly	repress	by	<RNA_Name>	
a	similar	result	be	obtain	from	the	same	experiment	perform	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	suggest	the	<Protein_Name>	as	an	important	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	regulation	machinery	
collectively	these	data	support	that	suppression	of	<RNA_Name>	by	<Protein_Name>	result	in	upregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	contributes	to	ctgf-mediated	inhibition	of	oscc	invasiveness	
here	we	find	that	amp-activated	protein	kinase	and	<Protein_Name>	be	oppositely	regulate	in	mouse	primary	hippocampal	neuron	impair	by	hypoxia-hypoglycemia	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	reduce	the	<Protein_Name>	level	by	upregulating	<Protein_Name>	and	be	negatively	posttranscriptionally	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	suggest	a	negative	regulatory	role	of	<Protein_Name>	in	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>

cell	model	study	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	likely	suppresses	prostate	tumor	growth	by	regulate	the	expression	of	gene	such	as	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	associate	with	cell-cycle	control	and	cellular	proliferation	
the	tumor-suppressive	<RNA_Name>	serve	as	a	negative	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	in	conclusion	we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	an	important	oncogene	in	hcc	and	aberrant	<Protein_Name>	up-regulation	be	partly	attribute	to	the	under	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	human	hcc	
take	together	our	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	up-regulation	be	contribute	by	the	underexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	
furthermore	mir-125b-overexpressing	hcc	cell	show	a	profound	reduction	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	both	messenger	rna	and	protein	level	
knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	stimulate	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	but	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	remain	unchanged	
however	knock-in	of	<RNA_Name>	suppress	transcript	expression	and	protein	expression	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	precursor	but	not	the	scrambled	sequence	significantly	inhibit	the	activity	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr-	or	<Protein_Name>	3'utr-containing	luciferase	in	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	cell	without	effect	on	the	control	luciferase	
collectively	the	data	demonstrate	the	presence	of	functional	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	the	3'-utrs	of	both	human	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
the	sensitivity	to	<RNA_Name>	of	the	less	evolutionarily	conserve	bind	site	identify	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	suggest	an	additive	contribution	to	<Protein_Name>	regulation

together	these	result	provide	a	molecular	mechanism	that	be	responsible	for	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	by	tap73	and	indicate	that	dnp73	activates	<Protein_Name>	signal	via	suppression	of	the	tap73-mir-885-5p	axis	
<Protein_Name>	be	experimentally	validate	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
moreover	addition	of	<Protein_Name>	counteract	the	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	cell	migration	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	that	a	single	site	within	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	sufficient	for	let-7g-mediated	gene	silence	
in	addition	we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	whose	expression	be	negatively	correlate	with	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	tissue	
to	conclude	our	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	target	its	3'utr	
to	far	elucidate	the	underlying	molecular	mechanism	by	which	<RNA_Name>	be	involve	in	hcc	metastasis	we	predict	the	putative	target	of	<RNA_Name>	use	bioinformatics	and	validate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	downstream	mediator	of	<RNA_Name>	through	luciferase	reporter	and	western	blot	assay	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
thus	it	be	quite	possible	that	human	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	unequivocally	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	recognize	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
furthermore	hydrogen	peroxide	treatment	suppress	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	suggest	that	ros	inhibit	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	greatly	decrease	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	both	cell	line	whereas	<RNA_Name>	decrease	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	but	not	<Protein_Name>	expression	
this	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	whereas	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	by	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	its	3'utr	
go	along	with	this	systemic	treatment	with	<RNA_Name>	increased	p-akt	p-gsk3-beta	and	p-p44	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	decrease	p-mtor	level	and	induced	autophagy	signaling	and	induce	early	and	delayed	cardioprotection	with	improved	functional	recovery	and	reduction	in	infarct	size	similar	to	that	achieve	by	ripc	
transfection	with	pre-mir-92a	caused	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	almost	<Number>	and	<Number>	fold	respectively	whereas	transfection	with	anti-mir-92a	do	not	significantly	affect	their	mrna	
we	also	show	that	<RNA_Name>	interacts	with	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	3'utr	and	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulates	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
these	finding	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	interacts	with	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	suppresses	<Protein_Name>	translation	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	in	hgc-27	cell	
moreover	we	also	demonstrate	that	the	ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	the	protein	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
here	we	show	for	the	first	time	that	in	s-ibm	muscle	biopsy	<RNA_Name>	transcript	be	significantly	increase	and	be	accompany	by	an	increase	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
our	present	finding	suggest	that	the	increase	<Protein_Name>	protein	result	at	least	partially	from	the	increase	transcription	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	quite	likely	drive	by	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	pancreatic	cancer	cell	line	
this	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	can	suppress	the	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	vivo	and	further	demonstrates	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
in	vitro	assay	show	that	<Protein_Name>	and	raf-1	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	which	potently	suppress	the	proliferation	of	crc	cell	and	interestingly	that	the	growth	inhibitory	effect	of	each	of	these	be	enhance	by	cetuximab	
binding	of	<RNA_Name>	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	the	3'utr	of	raf-1	mrna	be	analyze	by	use	a	luciferase	assay	
these	data	suggest	that	the	3'-utrs	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	raf-1	be	direct	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
conversely	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	lead	to	increase	total	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	activity	however	without	reach	statistical	significance	
similarly	treatment	with	anti-mir-223	lead	to	a	reduction	of	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	
transfection	of	hpaec	with	<RNA_Name>	decrease	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	to	<Number>	<Number>	<Number>	<Number>	p	'	<Number>	<Number>	whereas	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	significantly	increase	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<Number>	<Number>	<Number>	036-fold	p	'	<Number>	<Number>	as	compare	to	control	cell	
<RNA_Name>	activates	<Protein_Name>	-beta-catenin	pathway	by	target	<Protein_Name>	gsk3-beta	and	<Protein_Name>	
however	neither	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	nor	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	have	effect	on	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	gsk3-beta	and	<Protein_Name>	suggesting	that	the	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	gsk3-beta	and	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	
<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	gsk3-beta	and	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	functionally	important	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	be	involve	in	the	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	regulated	proliferation	of	hacat	cell	
furthermore	overexpression	of	a	<RNA_Name>	precursor	in	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	b-raf	er	cell	have	little	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	at	the	mrna	level	suggest	post-transcriptional	regulation	at	the	level	of	translation	
strikingly	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	result	in	marked	downregulation	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	protein	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	can	affect	cell	proliferation	through	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	
thus	our	data	show	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	through	direct	binding	to	its	3'utr	
the	luciferase	reporter	that	contain	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	significantly	suppress	by	pre-mir-193b	whereas	the	mutated	reporter	be	not	affected	
in	conclusion	our	experiment	have	show	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	novel	tumor	suppressor	in	breast	cancer	through	regulation	of	at	least	the	transcription	factor	<Protein_Name>	and	the	expression	of	oncogene	<Protein_Name>

luciferase	assay	with	nih-3t3	cell	transiently	transfected	with	reporter	gene	contain	these	seed	sequence	along	with	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	expression	vector	be	consistent	with	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
here	we	suggest	that	il-6-mediated	induction	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	may	slow	cll	progression	by	downregulating	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	cllcells	and	inhibit	their	proliferative	response	toendogenous	<Protein_Name>	ligand	
in	silico	analysis	identify	a	<RNA_Name>	binding	domain	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	which	be	verify	in	a	series	of	experiment	
the	ovarian	cancer	cell	line	a2780	which	express	the	high	level	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	expression	level	display	the	low	<RNA_Name>	expression	level

furthermore	<RNA_Name>	act	as	an	endogenous	potent	regulator	by	directly	bind	to	<RNA_Name>	and	down-regulating	<RNA_Name>	expression	
these	data	show	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	breast	cancer	cell	
these	result	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	may	interact	with	<RNA_Name>	by	this	putative	binding	site	in	this	study	we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	suppress	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	breast	cancer	which	invert	the	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	the	tumor	growth	of	breast	cancer	cell	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	
as	demonstrate	with	qpcrs	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	down-regulated	by	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	while	remain	unchanged	by	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	
the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	decrease	by	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	while	increase	by	<RNA_Name>	downregulation	in	h460	cell	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	might	be	a	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	in	h460	cell	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	-induced	apoptosis	in	retinoblastoma	cell	be	part	mediate	by	decrease	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	which	subsequently	increase	caspase-3	expression	
the	three	series	of	experiment	be	design	to	explore	if	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	support	that	<Protein_Name>	gene	be	the	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>

a	detailed	analysis	of	target	protein	by	available	literature	identify	among	many	other	protein	<Protein_Name>	to	be	a	probable	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
western	blot	analysis	of	<RNA_Name>	target	protein	<Protein_Name>	show	a	sharp	decrease	in	both	dio	bdcm	group	and	dio	<Protein_Name>	group	as	compare	to	dio	only	group

the	strong	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	modulate	<Protein_Name>	in	a549	than	that	of	nci-520	cell	line	indicate	that	the	<RNA_Name>	specially	bind	rs2758383c	allele	of	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	and	suppress	the	expression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	in	vitro	in	conclusion	in	these	two	independent	hospital-based	case-control	study	of	lung	cancer	our	data	suggest	that	the	functional	polymorphism	rs2735383g	c	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	confers	an	increase	risk	of	lung	cancer	via	the	binding	of	microrna	hsamir-629	
target	gene	search	for	<Protein_Name>	be	perform	by	use	multiple	database	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	might	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	due	to	the	presence	of	a	putative	binding	site	within	its	3'utr

these	result	suggest	that	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	repress	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	the	predicted	targeting	site	in	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
however	since	investigate	this	interesting	phenomenon	be	outside	the	scope	of	this	paper	we	decide	to	study	homer-1b	as	its	3'-utrs	could	be	greatly	silence	by	<RNA_Name>	both	in	vivo	and	in	vitro	
these	line	of	evidence	suggest	that	the	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	in	zebrafish	embryo	can	specifically	silence	luc	expression	through	the	3'utr	from	homer-1b	mrna

the	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	<Protein_Name>	through	its	3'utr	region	
in	mammary	epithelial	cell	and	breast	carcinoma	cell	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	suppress	the	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	an	mrna	encode	a	transcriptional	repressor	that	inhibit	expression	of	several	gene	involve	in	cell	migration	and	extracellular	matrix	remodel	such	as	<Protein_Name>	urokinase	<Protein_Name>	activator	receptor	alpha3-integrin	and	mt1-mmp	<Number>

these	fact	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	specially	bindto	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	repress	the	gene	expression	
these	data	highlight	the	prediction	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	targetfor	<RNA_Name>	
as	a	result	when	<RNA_Name>	be	block	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	subsequently	elevate	compare	with	the	control	group	with	a	<Number>	increase	extent	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	through	mechanism	of	mrna	degradation	
we	validate	the	technique	use	a	biotin-tagged	<RNA_Name>	target	several	report	target	such	as	cat-1	<Protein_Name>	and	bcl-w

therefore	we	carry	out	in	vitro	experiment	to	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	as	well	as	<Protein_Name>	be	indeed	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	respectively	
identical	experiment	with	a	luciferase	construct	contain	mouse	3'utr	region	of	<Protein_Name>	be	conduct	to	test	if	<RNA_Name>	target	this	gene	
our	result	indicate	that	in	vivo	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	with	its	lna-antimir	inhibitor	significantly	increase	<Protein_Name>	expression	on	both	gene	and	protein	level	
furthermore	bioinformatics	analysis	and	in	vitro	study	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	play	a	critical	role	in	mediate	the	effect	of	folate	on	cell	proliferation	and	cell	cycle-specific	apoptosis	by	target	<Protein_Name>	gene	
moreover	up-regulating	<RNA_Name>	in	dc	effectively	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>

this	observation	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	addition	<RNA_Name>	could	directly	targetthe	main	adaptor	protein	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	on	dc	
we	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	targetgene	of	<RNA_Name>	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	a	decrease	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	u373mg	and	shg44	cell	indicate	the	negative	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	
the	binding	be	specific	because	the	luciferase	with	the	mutate	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	not	affect	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	targetgene	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	support	the	inference	that	the	tumor-suppressing	activity	of	<RNA_Name>	be	mediate	through	negative	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>

these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	target	<Protein_Name>	gene	through	the	8-mer	seeding	region	of	3'utr	
take	together	our	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	attenuate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
we	show	that	only	the	8-mer	site	contribute	to	<RNA_Name>	repress	action	on	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	similar	result	be	obtain	in	a	recent	study	on	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	in	macrophage	
in	addition	to	the	know	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	we	identify	aryl	hydrocarbon	nuclear	translocator	messenger	rna	as	a	novel	target	of	<RNA_Name>	which	contribute	to	the	pro-proliferative	activity	of	<RNA_Name>	
next	to	investigate	whether	cell	cycle	regulator	be	affect	by	knockdown	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	we	determine	the	protein	level	of	the	cdk	inhibitor	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
the	mirna	target	analysis	tool	mirwalk	<Number>	be	use	to	screen	validated	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	be	find	to	be	a	validated	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	a	validated	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	hipk2a	gene	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
to	confirm	the	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	a	correlation	analysis	be	carry	out	
a	negative	correlation	be	find	between	each	gene	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	the	correlated	mirna	
the	expression	of	the	three	mirna	target	gene	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	study	
interestingly	an	inverse	trend	of	gene	expression	be	highlight	compare	to	that	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
high	median	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	find	in	gastric	n3	tumor	and	in	male	while	no	difference	be	find	in	gene	expression	with	respect	to	tumor	size	or	gc	patient	age	
these	data	establish	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	the	gata-4	3'utr	region	result	in	mrna	degradation	and	translation	repression	
<RNA_Name>	be	a	direct	regulator	of	cox-2	expression	in	oa	chondrocytes	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	both	bindthe	seed	sequence	present	in	the	3'utr	of	human	cox-2	mrna	but	the	inhibitory	effect	on	luciferase	activity	be	more	pronounced	for	<RNA_Name>	
this	suggest	an	indirect	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	on	the	post-transcriptional	regulation	of	cox-2	expression	in	oa	chondrocytes	
these	data	suggest	that	il-1-beta-induced	activation	of	p38-mapk	negatively	regulate	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	which	may	be	necessary	for	the	unobstructed	translation	of	cox-2	mrna	and	expression	of	cox-2	protein	in	human	oa	chondrocytes	
to	identify	the	target	gene	of	the	<RNA_Name>	with	<Protein_Name>	through	the	informatics	software	we	find	the	bind	site	as	dual	luciferase	data	show	that	the	<RNA_Name>	can	obviously	inhibit	the	luciferase	activity	of	ulk1-3'utr	but	not	the	luciferase	activity	of	ulk1-3'utr	mutant	our	data	show	that	the	<RNA_Name>	can	obviously	inhibit	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	by	western-blot	
thus	our	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	capable	of	directly	target	a	sequence	within	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	that	<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	the	key	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	treg-cell	differentiation	
<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	possess	several	putative	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	that	be	responsible	for	down-regulation	by	<RNA_Name>	
to	determine	whether	these	site	allow	down-regulation	by	<RNA_Name>	and	thus	whether	<RNA_Name>	can	down-regulate	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	well	as	the	chimeric	mll-af4	and	af4-mll	mrna	the	3'utr	region	contain	these	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	be	clone	downstream	of	the	reporter	renilla	luciferase	open	reading	frame	
in	this	study	we	observe	that	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	be	inversely	correlate	with	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	several	different	breast	carcinoma	cell	line	
increase	cytoplasmic	localization	of	<Protein_Name>	be	a	prognostic	marker	in	breast	cancer	
real	time	pcr	and	gene	reporter	assay	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	translationally	repress	by	<RNA_Name>	
re-establishing	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	breast	cancer	cell	decrease	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	and	inhibit	cell	growth	
importantly	the	repression	of	cell	proliferation	and	migration	engender	by	<RNA_Name>	be	partly	rescue	by	<Protein_Name>	re-expression	
our	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	function	as	a	tumor	suppressor	for	breast	cancer	with	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	and	functional	target	
we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	also	block	<Protein_Name>	function	to	restore	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	through	the	3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	respectively	
in	summary	these	experiment	lead	us	to	conclude	that	<Protein_Name>	be	able	to	block	<Protein_Name>	function	and	restore	mirna-mediated	translation	repression	
in	turn	<Protein_Name>	be	also	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	our	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	this	study	we	have	find	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	repress	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	in	turn	<Protein_Name>	suppress	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	
modulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	level	follow	lipopolysaccharide	tnf-alpha	stimulation	and	their	possible	role	in	regulate	the	response	to	endotoxin	shock	
we	find	a	significant	negative	regulatory	effect	on	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	by	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
mutation	of	the	potential	binding	site	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	result	in	a	loss	of	responsiveness	to	the	corresponding	mirna	
our	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	involve	in	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	possibly	in	the	development	of	prostate	cancer	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	show	that	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	an	independent	targetfor	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
since	the	stimulation	of	<Protein_Name>	transcription	by	this	small	rna	do	not	depend	on	any	sequence	from	within	the	<Protein_Name>	transcript	<Protein_Name>	act	either	directly	or	indirectly	on	<Protein_Name>	transcription	initiation	
in	addition	<Protein_Name>	be	identify	to	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	through	western	blot	and	luciferase	reporter	assay	
luciferase	reporter	assay	and	western	blot	be	perform	to	validate	the	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	the	western	blot	analysis	the	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	could	significantly	upregulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	compare	with	the	control	group	
as	for	the	luciferase	reporter	assay	<RNA_Name>	decreased	luciferase	activity	with	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	but	have	no	effect	on	luciferase	reporter	with	mutate	<RNA_Name>	binding	element

overexpression	of	a	second	srna	<RNA_Name>	also	activate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	an	unknown	way	the	data	reveal	a	regulatory	that	<RNA_Name>	act	indirectly	in	a	way	that	depend	on	<RNA_Name>	
when	the	intracellular	glcn-6-p	concentration	decrease	<RNA_Name>	accumulates	and	cause	in	turn	accumulation	of	full-length	<RNA_Name>	which	finally	activate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	<RNA_Name>	mutant	<RNA_Name>	have	no	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	whereas	artificially	express	<RNA_Name>	can	activate	<Protein_Name>	expression	also	in	the	absence	of	<RNA_Name>	
impressively	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	show	the	same	phenocopy	as	the	effect	of	<Protein_Name>	knockdown	in	nsclc	cell	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	major	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
furthermore	use	western	blot	analysis	and	luciferase	reporter	assay	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	be	prove	to	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	through	binding	to	the	putative	binding	site	in	its	3'-untranslated	region	
the	above	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	directly	target	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	far	prove	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	could	be	mediate	by	<RNA_Name>	through	target	its	mrna	3'utr	
figure	<Number>	curcuminoids	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	through	a	mir-27a-ros-dependent	suppression	
in	addition	<Protein_Name>	be	a	<RNA_Name>	mrna	target	and	a	member	of	the	<Protein_Name>	family	of	transcriptional	repressor	
moreover	in	cell	transfected	with	pzbtb10-3'utr	luciferase	construct	treatment	with	curcuminoids	increase	luciferase	activity	directly	link	to	suppression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	decreased	interaction	with	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	transfection	with	the	<Protein_Name>	expression	vector	decrease	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	sp-regulated	gene	<Protein_Name>	
the	result	indicate	that	the	suppression	of	<RNA_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	aso	significantly	increase	both	the	mrna	and	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	
combine	targetprediction	bioinformatics	with	expression	profile	we	identify	<Protein_Name>	which	be	remarkably	upregulated	in	<RNA_Name>	aso	treat	cell	as	a	candidate	targetgene	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	finding	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	confirm	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
exposure	of	esophageal	cell	to	bile	acid	activate	<Protein_Name>	and	increase	level	of	mirs	<Number>	and	<Number>	reducing	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	promote	degradation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	the	proteasome	
subsequently	<RNA_Name>	silence	<Protein_Name>	post-transcriptionally	in	the	cell	treat	with	hdaci	
thus	a	regulatory	loop	may	exist	in	human	breast	cancer	cell	involve	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	that	be	control	by	<Protein_Name>	signal	
silencing	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	inhibited	cancer	progression	and	activated	apoptosis	but	silencing	of	<Protein_Name>	have	a	converse	effect	
base	on	computational	analysis	reveal	<Number>	mir-16-binding	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	we	conduct	western	blot	analysis	and	luciferase	reporter	gene	assay	to	experimentally	clarify	whether	<Protein_Name>	be	in	fact	a	target	for	<RNA_Name>	
transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	into	h9c2	rat	ventricular	cell	produce	marked	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	protein	expression	compare	to	sham-treated	control	cell

we	also	find	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	a	pro-apoptotic	protein	kinase	via	target	its	3'-untranslated	region	thereby	inhibit	irradiation-induced	apoptosis	and	decrease	g2	m	block	
these	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	also	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	cardiomyocyte	
the	suppression	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	decreased	expression	of	k-ras	and	nf-kappab	both	at	the	mrna	level	and	at	the	protein	level	
these	result	suggest	that	inhibit	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	caf-19	cell	lead	to	the	inhibition	of	cell	migration	invasion	and	the	expression	of	its	target	k-ras	and	nf-kappab	
<Protein_Name>	phosphorylates	<Protein_Name>	protein	at	serine-46	
this	enhance	<Protein_Name>	protein	stability	and	its	transcriptional	activity	lead	to	transcriptional	activation	of	p53-target	gene	such	as	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	cell	growth	arrest	and	apoptosis	upon	dna	damage	stress

we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	downregulated	in	two	prostate	cancer	cell	line	ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	suppress	cell	migratory	and	invasive	capacity	of	<Protein_Name>	and	du145	cell	through	inhibition	of	fra-1	
these	finding	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	be	a	potential	tumor	suppressor	by	directly	bind	to	fra-1	in	prostate	cancer	
these	finding	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibited	fra-1	expression	through	direct	binding	of	3'utr	of	its	transcript	
moreover	dual	luciferase	reporter	assay	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	could	specifically	inhibit	fra-1	by	bind	to	a	critical	region	locate	on	its	3'utr	
it	be	confirm	flotillin-1	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	could	decrease	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	gastric	cancer	cell	
our	study	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	be	a	potential	prognostic	marker	and	function	as	a	tumor	suppressor	in	human	gastric	cancer	by	post-transcriptionally	target	<Protein_Name>	in	a	conclusion	our	study	find	that	<RNA_Name>	be	identify	a	tumor	suppressor	mirna	in	gastric	cancer	cell	and	can	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	vitro	and	in	vivo

the	online	software	targetscan	predict	that	<Protein_Name>	have	a	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	its	3'utr	
the	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	indeed	a	target	gene	protein	of	<RNA_Name>	in	vivo	
to	explore	whether	<RNA_Name>	can	serve	as	a	therapeutic	target	for	glioblastoma	we	downregulated	<RNA_Name>	with	a	specific	antisense	oligonucleotide	and	find	that	apoptosis	be	induce	and	cell-cycle	progression	be	inhibit	in	vitro	in	u251	and	ln229	gbm	cell	xenograft	tumor	from	antisense-treated	u251	cell	be	suppress	in	vivo

luciferase	report	assay	far	confirm	that	tgf-alpha	3'utr	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	this	study	we	provide	an	important	insight	in	support	of	<RNA_Name>	functioning	as	a	tumor	suppressor	in	os	via	target	tgf-alpha	
moreover	mir-205-transfected	cell	show	a	dramatic	decrease	in	cell	invasion	and	migration	accompany	with	suppressed	expression	of	tgf-alpha	which	contain	a	putative	binding	site	of	<RNA_Name>	in	its	3'utr	confirm	by	luciferase	assay	and	qrt-pcr	and	western	blot	result	confirm	that	in	os	cell	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	the	expression	of	tgf-alpha	mrna	and	protein	be	both	suppress	
our	data	also	verify	that	bcl-2	be	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
more	importantly	we	prove	that	<RNA_Name>	increase	the	chemosensitivity	of	osteosarcoma	cell	line	to	cisplatin	by	target	bcl-2	
additionally	we	demonstrate	that	bcl-2	be	a	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	binding	to	its	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	bcl-2	by	bind	its	seed	region	to	their	3'utr	in	o	cell	
take	together	these	result	show	clearly	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	confirm	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	identify	the	site	of	interaction	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
interestingly	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	also	decrease	in	relation	to	the	transfected	amount	of	<RNA_Name>	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	operate	through	destabilizing	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
we	therefore	conclude	that	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
this	pattern	of	expression	exhibit	an	inverse	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	in	spermatogenesis	
these	result	clearly	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulates	<Protein_Name>	in	spermatogenesis	
next	we	use	luciferase	reporter	assay	base	on	luciferase	construct	harbor	wt	or	mutate	<RNA_Name>	mres	sequence	in	the	3'utr	to	confirm	that	all	four	gene	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	but	not	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	which	encode	an	establish	and	crucial	chaperone	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	and	low	<Protein_Name>	level	may	partially	explain	the	high	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	detect	upon	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	
we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	a	conserved	anti-apoptotic	and	stress-resistance	network	that	include	the	essential	<Protein_Name>	cell	chaperone	<Protein_Name>	and	the	caspase	inhibitor	<Protein_Name>	
in	silico	database	and	genome-wide	gene	expression	analysis	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	regulation	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	bound	directly	to	specific	site	in	the	3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	data	suggest	that	the	role	of	<Protein_Name>	or	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	modulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	the	effect	of	migration	and	invasion	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	
b-cell	translocationgene	<Number>	be	identify	as	a	new	target	of	<RNA_Name>	which	could	reverse	theinhibition	of	autophagy	induce	by	<RNA_Name>	
thus	<Protein_Name>	be	a	key	targetfor	the	cell	cycle	function	of	the	<RNA_Name>	family	
we	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	its	silencing	play	a	key	role	in	mir-106b-induced	cell	cycle	phenotype	
the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	3'utr	contains	two	hexamers	complementary	to	the	<RNA_Name>	family	seed	region	
to	test	for	direct	effect	on	the	<Protein_Name>	transcript	by	<RNA_Name>	micrornas	we	use	a	luciferase	reporter	carry	the	complete	<Protein_Name>	mrna	3'utr	
here	we	investigate	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	two	of	its	target	<Protein_Name>	and	suppressor	of	cytokine	signalling-3	during	human	skin	morphogenesis	
as	one	may	expect	it	with	mirna	target	pair	<Protein_Name>	and	socs-3	as	its	target	be	preferentially	express	in	the	basal	epidermal	layer	where	<RNA_Name>	be	absent	
to	demonstrate	the	specificity	of	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	the	mirna	recognition	motif	within	socs-3	3'utr	we	generate	a	site-specific	mutation	in	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	
when	the	predict	<RNA_Name>	bind	site	in	the	3'utr	of	socs-3	mrna	be	mutate	luciferase	activity	be	restore

<Protein_Name>	an	antiapoptotic	molecule	be	identify	to	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	the	<Protein_Name>	function	of	<RNA_Name>	be	mainly	through	target	<Protein_Name>	expression	
however	<RNA_Name>	can	not	decrease	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	which	suggest	that	the	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	<RNA_Name>	be	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	
take	together	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	thus	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	signaling

all	these	found	illustrate	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	increase	the	apoptosis	of	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	cell	depend	on	hif-1alpha	on	hypoxia	
hence	our	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	gsk3-beta	and	<Protein_Name>	be	the	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	demonstated	that	<Protein_Name>	gsk3-beta	and	<Protein_Name>	be	important	for	mir-942-induced	stem	cell-like	trait	and	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	-beta-catenin	signalling	be	a	functional	mediator	for	mir-942-	nduced	function	in	escc	cell	line

to	verify	the	change	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	follow	hb	or	rapamycin	treatment	we	perform	qrt-pcr	analysis	of	the	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	expression	
use	the	mimic	and	antagomir	of	<RNA_Name>	these	experiment	demonstrate	a	suppressive	role	for	this	mirna	in	beclin	<Number>	expression	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	its	3'utr	
there	be	an	inverse	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	in	hcc	cell	line

therefore	<RNA_Name>	regulates	reporter	expression	specifically	via	site	<Number>	in	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
thus	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	in	human	<Protein_Name>	cell	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	specifically	via	site	<Number>	in	3'utr	
the	fact	that	<RNA_Name>	be	predict	to	be	only	partially	complementary	to	the	c	ebpalpha	3'utr	bindsg	site	strengthen	our	hypothesis	that	<RNA_Name>	might	block	translation	of	c	ebpalpha	mrna	rather	than	degrade	it

such	target	effect	be	specific	to	<RNA_Name>	binding	because	the	reporter	activity	be	less	affected	when	transfections	be	repeat	with	mutant	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
the	above	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	definitely	one	of	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	both	normal	and	<Protein_Name>	cell	and	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	could	alleviate	the	repression	and	upregulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>

in	corroboration	with	early	study	on	<RNA_Name>	function	in	innate	immune	cell	this	study	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	b	negatively	regulate	the	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	rat	macrophage	
dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	show	that	<Protein_Name>	--	betawas	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	addition	the	dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	--	betais	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>

further	study	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	bind	to	its	3'-untranslated	region	
in	addition	western	blot	analysis	demonstrate	that	the	stably	express	<RNA_Name>	significantly	inhibit	the	endogenous	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	both	through	induced-mrna	degradation	and	translational	repression	which	be	consistent	with	a	recent	report	show	that	the	repression	of	mrna	by	mirnas	be	cellular-context	dependent	
collectively	our	data	suggest	that	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	<RNA_Name>	be	at	least	in	part	responsible	for	<RNA_Name>	suppression	of	cell	migration	and	invasion	and	consequently	lymph	node	metastasis	in	human	gc

these	data	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	down-regulation	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	inhibit	the	proliferation	of	hepg2	<Number>	<Number>	cell	
thus	<RNA_Name>	play	an	important	role	in	hbv-related	hcc	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
we	have	previously	demonstrate	that	the	pluripotency	factor	<Protein_Name>	be	also	directly	target	via	<RNA_Name>	and	can	regulate	stem	cell	signal	in	breast	cancer	cell	
additionally	we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulated	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	
we	also	find	that	knockdown	of	<Protein_Name>	significantly	resort	the	proliferation	and	apoptosis	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	
we	further	determine	that	overexpression	of	mir-	548d-	3p	downregulated	the	expression	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	on	both	mrna	and	protein	level	in	mda-mb-231	cell

consistent	with	this	an	increase	in	<Protein_Name>	transcript	level	be	observe	in	<RNA_Name>	morphants	as	compare	with	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	show	that	the	increase	or	reduction	of	endodermal	cell	number	cause	by	raise	or	lower	<Protein_Name>	level	together	with	the	finding	that	increase	and	decreased	level	of	<RNA_Name>	have	converse	effect	that	can	be	offset	by	altered	<Protein_Name>	expression	support	the	idea	that	the	mir-92-gata5	regulatory	interaction	be	involve	in	allocate	correct	endodermal	cell	number	and	maintain	proper	left-right	patterning	
these	result	strongly	support	the	hypothesis	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	endoderm	formation	and	left-right	asymmetry	by	control	<Protein_Name>	expression	
after	<RNA_Name>	transfection	the	expression	of	caspase	<Number>	be	up-regulated	whereas	the	expression	of	p-akt	and	survivin	be	down-regulated

the	result	show	that	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	be	significantly	high	in	lung	cancer	tissue	than	in	paracancerous	and	normal	tissue	whereas	apaf-1	expression	be	low	in	the	lung	cancerous	tissue

downregulation	of	tumor	suppressive	<RNA_Name>	which	target	oncogenic	gene	include	<Protein_Name>	might	contribute	to	<Protein_Name>	development

take	together	these	result	verify	that	4e-bp1	mrna	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>

<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	confirm	as	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	luciferase	reporter	assay	and	western	blot	
moreover	introduction	of	<RNA_Name>	mimic	into	mcf-7	could	effectively	down-regulate	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	decrease	the	<Protein_Name>	phosphorylation	level	in	conclusion	endothelial-specific	<RNA_Name>	be	excise	from	<Protein_Name>	pre-mrna	without	affect	splicing	and	expression	of	its	host	gene	and	could	targetboth	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
we	find	a	significant	decrease	in	the	expression	level	of	<RNA_Name>	and	a	significant	increase	in	that	of	cox-2	both	at	the	mrna	and	protein	level	
the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	other	target	of	<RNA_Name>	be	not	significantly	alter	at	the	mrna	level	but	substantially	increase	at	the	protein	level	
the	increase	in	the	protein	amount	without	a	significant	change	in	the	rna	amount	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	post-transcriptionally	in	the	liver	of	the	mouse

among	these	<Protein_Name>	<RNA_Name>	associated	process	apoptosis	and	cell	cycle	arrest	be	know	as	essential	for	<Protein_Name>	mir-34-mediated	tumor	suppression	
a	negative	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	also	observe	in	normal	breast	epithelial	cell	line	mcf-10a	and	bc	cell	line	suggest	that	the	<Protein_Name>	be	the	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	the	gene	of	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	which	may	play	an	essential	role	for	the	sensitivity	of	tumor	cell	to	chemotherapeutic	agent	
in	this	study	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	myeloid	differentiation	of	hl	<Number>	cell	
<RNA_Name>	have	perfect	complementarity	with	targetsequence	of	3'utr	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
exogenous	express	<RNA_Name>	repressed	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	via	cleave	mrna	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	participates	in	myeloid	differentiation	of	hl60	cell	via	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
<RNA_Name>	mirnas	targetp85alpha	and	<Protein_Name>	
another	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	mirnas	be	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	which	contain	two	targetsites	for	<RNA_Name>	
the	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	<Protein_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	that	be	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	mirnas	as	determine	by	western	blotting	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	preferentially	target	c-myb	translation	
interestingly	<Protein_Name>	be	the	most	widely	report	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	which	be	downregulated	by	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	
importantly	transient	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	mimetics	in	hct116	sw480	and	dld-1	colon	cancer	cell	line	have	be	show	to	down-regulate	<Protein_Name>	steady-state	level

the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	negatively	correlate	with	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	inra	patient	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	raneutrophils	
far	oncogene	<Protein_Name>	be	reveal	to	be	a	putative	target	of	<RNA_Name>	which	be	inversely	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	nsclc	
here	we	report	that	<RNA_Name>	be	indeed	suppress	in	primary	lung	cancer	compare	with	the	matching	adjacent	normal	tissue	and	find	3'utr	of	the	human	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	really	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	directly	to	the	predict	binding	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	in	lung	cancer	cell	and	negatively	express	with	<Protein_Name>	
here	we	validate	tnf-alpha	as	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	a	dual	luciferase	assay	
our	study	provide	the	first	evidence	of	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	adipocyte	differentiation	by	regulation	of	tnf-alpha	which	may	become	a	new	therapeutic	target	for	anti-obesity	drug	in	this	study	we	demonstrate	the	ability	<RNA_Name>	to	inhibit	tnf-alpha	expression	by	target	the	3'utr	of	its	mrna	thus	affect	adipogenesis	
thus	tnf-alpha	be	initially	confirm	as	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
this	study	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	novel	regulator	of	tnf-alpha	in	porcine	adipocytes	
nevertheless	the	ppar-alpha	protein	level	decrease	and	increase	significantly	after	the	overexpression	and	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	respectively	
thus	these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	recognize	the	3'utr	of	the	ppar-alpha	transcript	and	mediate	its	expression	post-transcriptionally	
<Protein_Name>	can	be	regulate	negatively	by	<RNA_Name>	at	both	transcriptional	level	and	protein	level	in	sw1990	and	panc-1	cell	
to	validate	whether	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	we	mutate	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	observed	loss	of	repression	
together	these	result	support	the	hypothesis	that	mcl-1	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	together	confirm	that	mcl-1	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	the	region	between	<Number>	<Number>	and	<Number>	<Number>	bp	downstream	of	the	stop	codon	be	a	targetsequence	to	which	<RNA_Name>	bind	in	short	the	overlap	in	phenotype	cause	by	either	mcl-1	downregulation	or	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	strongly	suggest	that	mcl-1	downregulation	be	a	critical	point	in	mir-193a-3p-induced	apoptosis	
together	these	observation	strongly	suggest	that	mcl-1	downregulation	be	a	critical	step	during	apoptosis	trigger	by	<RNA_Name>	
figue	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	expression	
the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	be	negatively	correlate	with	the	protein	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	whereas	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	positively	correlate	with	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	the	peripheral	blood	of	patient	with	mdd	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	reduce	the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	at	both	the	mrna	and	protein	level	whereas	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	increase	the	mrna	and	protein	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	may	regulate	hippocampal	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	an	opposite	manner	suggest	that	homeostatic	interaction	between	these	factor	control	hippocampal	<Protein_Name>	expression	
here	we	show	post-transcriptional	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	three	micrornas	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
together	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	downregulate	its	expression	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	three	mirnas	with	altered	expression	profile	in	multiple	neuropsychiatric	disorder	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
a	luciferase	reporter	assay	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	bind	to	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
luciferase	activity	level	be	significantly	reduce	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	with	the	wild	type	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	co-transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	however	luciferase	activity	level	do	not	change	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	with	mutant	type	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	co-transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	compare	with	the	control	group	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
therefore	the	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	protein	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	gastric	carcinoma	cell	perhaps	by	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
the	present	study	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	gastric	carcinoma	cell	and	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	downregulated	whereas	<Protein_Name>	be	upregulated	in	gastric	carcinoma	cell	line	as	compare	with	normal	gastric	mucosal	epithelial	cell	
we	presentcompelling	evidence	that	<Protein_Name>	a	guanidine	exchange	factor	of	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
thus	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	appear	to	control	<Protein_Name>	expression	mainly	through	repression	of	the	protein	translation	not	degradation	of	the	mrna	
<Number>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	also	down-regulated	<Protein_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	and	sw480	cell	
importantly	we	find	that	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	do	not	cause	a	significant	change	in	mature	<RNA_Name>	level	and	vice	versa	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	do	not	influence	the	expression	level	of	each	other	and	likely	impact	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	independently	
this	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	also	directly	repress	<Protein_Name>	translation	
these	data	far	substantiate	our	model	that	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	a	critical	component	in	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	regulation	of	migratory	and	invasive	property	of	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	cell	
the	basal	level	of	the	anti-apoptotic	protein	bcl-w	be	high	in	bel-7402	5-fu	cell	and	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	repress	bcl-w	protein	level	and	inhibit	the	luciferase	activity	of	a	bcl-w	3'untranslated	region-based	reporter	construct	in	both	bel-7402	5-fu	and	bel-7402	cell	
take	together	these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	enhance	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	and	that	the	interaction	of	<RNA_Name>	with	human	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	critically	depend	on	the	presence	of	the	g2252	variant	
intriguingly	this	posttranscriptional	pathway	regulate	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	be	alter	by	the	presence	of	the	g2252c	variant	in	the	3'utr	of	human	<Protein_Name>	which	be	frequently	present	in	a	cohort	of	ttc	patient	suggest	that	epi-induced	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	may	potentially	represent	new	molecular	component	in	the	disease	pathogenesis	of	ttc	
skeletal	muscle-specific	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	in	dmdmdx-5cv	animal	decrease	level	of	<Protein_Name>	reduce	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	subsequently	increased	level	of	phosphorylated	<Protein_Name>	which	result	in	an	overall	beneficial	effect

take	together	these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	negatively	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	both	bc	cell	and	tissue	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibited	hif-1alpha	3'utr	luciferase	activity	and	hif-1alpha	protein	level	in	hepg2	smmc-7721	and	<RNA_Name>	cell	
we	subsequently	identify	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
re-expression	of	<Protein_Name>	could	partially	rescue	the	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	the	capacity	of	nsclc	cell	proliferation	and	motility

the	evolutionary	conservation	of	this	antisense	sense	transcriptional	organization	strongly	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	transcript	play	a	significant	biological	role	in	both	human	and	mouse	presumably	as	a	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
as	a	result	<Protein_Name>	be	a	binding	target	of	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	and	u2os	cell	remarkably	decrease	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	
next	we	far	demonstrate	whether	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	use	luciferase	reporter	assay	
the	result	show	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	decrease	the	luciferase	activity	of	pmir-foxm1	3'utr	wt	where	as	mutation	of	the	mir-370-binding	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	abolish	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>

inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	may	also	assist	in	this	growth-suppression	effect	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	reduce	endothelial	cell	survival	and	suppress	angiogenesis	through	target	<Protein_Name>	in	vitro	
we	hypothesize	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	may	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	may	indirectly	target	<Protein_Name>	
the	above	result	may	preliminarily	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	and	that	<Protein_Name>	be	an	indirect	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	identify	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	our	study	we	have	verify	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	use	western	blotting	and	luciferase	reporter	assay	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
data	of	luciferase	reporter	assay	and	western	blot	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	proliferation	of	colon	cancer	by	target	<Protein_Name>

moreover	<RNA_Name>	could	directly	bind	to	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
this	study	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	might	regulate	ischemia	reperfusion-induced	rat	neuronal	cell	death	via	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	bound	directly	to	a	specific	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	a	post-transcriptional	manner

<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	
our	present	data	clearly	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	regulate	by	tumor-suppressive	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	
a	combination	of	bioinformatics	pcr	array	dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	and	western	blot	analysis	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	ligand	and	death	receptor	<Number>	be	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
in	the	present	study	we	construct	a	luciferase	reporter	system	and	identified	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	finding	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	promotes	emt	and	bone	invasion	in	prostate	cancer	by	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	emt	and	invasion	at	least	in	part	through	repress	<Protein_Name>	
thus	these	observation	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	through	interact	with	the	3'utr	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	
genetic	evidence	obtain	in	the	mouse	confirm	the	importance	of	<Protein_Name>	regulation	by	<RNA_Name>	c	
several	line	of	evidence	verify	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	provide	an	in	vivo	verification	of	the	importance	of	<Protein_Name>	regulation	by	<RNA_Name>	and	-c	in	osteoblast	in	vivo	
the	direct	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	explains	why	these	mirnas	regulate	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	possibly	other	gene	whose	expression	be	control	by	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	or	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
although	target	mrna	frequently	have	multiple	copy	of	mirna	target	site	in	their	3'utr	examination	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	sequence	reveal	a	single	potential	target	sequence	for	<RNA_Name>	in	its	3'utr	
these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	potential	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	recognize	the	putative	recognition	site	present	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
these	data	be	consistent	with	previous	report	that	list	<Protein_Name>	mrna	as	one	of	a	set	of	mrna	that	be	up-regulated	by	knock	down	<RNA_Name>	in	vivo	
although	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	do	not	affect	the	rna	level	of	the	<Protein_Name>	reporter	gene	the	knock	down	of	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	significantly	increase	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	in	mouse	liver	
our	data	thus	demonstrate	that	this	robustly	rhythmic	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	liver	be	shape	at	least	in	part	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	phenotype	be	dependent	on	two	of	the	<RNA_Name>	target	validate	in	this	study	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>

the	data	show	that	<RNA_Name>	in	skov3	and	a2780	cell	inhibited	proliferation	of	the	cell	with	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	
western	blot	result	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	decrease	in	saos-2	cell	after	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	
the	overexpression	or	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	do	not	affect	the	mrna	stability	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	which	be	the	most	common	mechanism	of	animal	mirna	action	
in	conclusion	our	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	transcript	to	suppress	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	crc	cell	
<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	can	all	specifically	interact	with	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	down	regulate	gene	expression	
thus	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	can	all	specifically	interact	with	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	down-regulate	gene	expression	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	can	also	targetendogenous	<Protein_Name>	in	dlbcl	cell

our	result	indicate	that	only	unedited	pri-mir-376	rna	be	present	in	the	cochlea	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	level	and	activity	in	the	inner	ear	may	not	be	regulate	through	the	editing	of	<RNA_Name>	
a	search	of	the	3'utr	of	the	human	<Protein_Name>	gene	reveal	two	evolutionarily	highly	conserve	and	two	poorly	conserve	<RNA_Name>	target	sequence	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
notably	by	analyze	of	their	expression	level	in	gc	tissue	the	expression	level	of	<RNA_Name>	be	find	to	be	negatively	associate	with	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression

accordingly	the	current	study	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	play	an	inhibitory	role	in	the	regulation	of	hepatocellular	carcinoma	cell	invasion	by	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
2b	the	luciferase	activity	be	significantly	reduce	in	hepg2	cell	co-transfected	with	the	wild-type	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	mimic	but	unchanged	in	hepg2	cell	co-transfected	with	the	mutant	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	<RNA_Name>	mimic	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	in	hepg2	cell	
further	investigation	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	the	protein	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	hepatocellular	carcinoma	cell	
these	finding	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	igf-ir	and	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	target	both	igf-ir	and	<Protein_Name>	in	beas-2b	cell	
more	importantly	we	validate	that	both	igf-ir	and	<Protein_Name>	be	the	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
western	blot	analysis	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	but	not	<RNA_Name>	decrease	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
however	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	not	affect	by	<RNA_Name>	
by	contrast	anti-mir-376c	increase	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
mutation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	targetsites	at	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	significantly	reduce	the	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	luciferase	activity	
furthermore	inhibition	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	by	anti-mir-376c	phenocopied	the	effect	of	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	and	decrease	the	size	of	spheroid	
mechanistic	analysis	identify	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	two	novel	<RNA_Name>	target	relevant	to	this	process	
we	show	direct	targeting	by	<RNA_Name>	to	the	<Number>	'	-untranslated	region	region	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	hnc-tics	and	far	show	a	direct	interaction	between	<Protein_Name>	and	adam17-promoter	by	chip	assay	
collectively	our	result	show	how	<RNA_Name>	target	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	axis	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	property	in	hnc	and	how	alter	this	pathway	may	partly	explain	the	anticancer	effect	of	curcumin	
therefore	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	human	neuron	by	specifically	interact	with	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	expression	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	
these	data	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	exhibit	inverse	expression	pattern	across	time	in	hfb	culture	and	suggest	that	the	inhibitory	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	could	underlie	these	pattern	
therefore	we	be	able	to	successfully	transfect	these	primary	human	neuronal	cell	and	demonstrate	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	follow	<RNA_Name>	delivery	
therefore	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	actively	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	human	neuron	under	physiological	culture	condition	
this	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	can	also	regulate	a-beta	level	presumably	via	its	activity	against	<Protein_Name>

accordingly	phosphorylation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	a	downstream	targetgene	of	the	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	pathway	be	decrease	when	<RNA_Name>	be	overexpressed	and	increase	in	the	absence	of	<RNA_Name>	support	that	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	<Protein_Name>	downstream	signaling	by	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	at	the	posttranscriptional	level	
to	further	confirm	targetspecificity	between	mir-	512-5p	and	its	potential	target	mcl-1	we	carry	out	luciferase	reporter	assay	with	a	vector	contain	the	putative	mcl-1	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	targetsite	downstream	of	the	luciferase	reporter	gene	which	be	transfected	into	<Protein_Name>	cell	
these	data	suggest	that	mcl-1	be	one	of	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	activation	of	<RNA_Name>	induces	suppression	of	mcl-1	result	in	apoptosis	of	gastric	cancer	cell

luciferase	assay	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	bindhe	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	transcript	and	expression	of	pre-mir-30c	down-regulated	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	
next	we	check	whether	<RNA_Name>	could	affect	<Protein_Name>	mrna	stability	by	perform	qrt-pcr	analysis	in	mda-mb-436	cell	transiently	transfected	with	either	pre-mir-30c	or	scramble	control	
indeed	we	observe	a	sharp	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	upon	transfections	with	pre-mir-30c	
therefore	modulation	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	by	<RNA_Name>	may	explain	at	least	in	part	why	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	can	promote	proliferation	and	contribute	to	tumorigenesis	
<RNA_Name>	can	directly	repress	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	target	3'utr	of	-beta-catenin	mrna	to	inhibit	its	expression	in	nsclc	cell	
these	data	support	the	prediction	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	raw264	<Number>	cell	
far	study	characterize	the	3-	untranslated	region	of	cyclin	d1	gene	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<RNA_Name>	and	u251	cell	as	determine	by	luciferase	reporter	assay	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	cyclin	d1	via	its	3'utr	in	gbm	cell	
here	we	reveal	that	cyclin	d1	be	a	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	act	to	enhance	cell	growth	potential	in	gbm	cell	
the	luciferase	assay	in	our	study	also	show	that	<RNA_Name>	alter	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	3'utr	reporter	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	suggesting	they	be	the	direct	target	
these	data	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
moreover	significantly	low	luciferase	activity	be	detect	in	the	cell	transfected	by	the	wild-type	il-7	construct	relative	to	the	construct	contain	the	mutate	<RNA_Name>	seed	region	indicate	that	the	il-7	transcript	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	be	suppress	by	osthole	in	du145	cell	and	directly	repress	e-cad	expression	through	binding	to	the	3'utr	of	the	human	e-cad	gene	
these	result	collectively	substantiate	that	<RNA_Name>	represses	<Protein_Name>	in	mammary	cell	
mutagenesis	of	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	within	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	result	in	increase	in	luciferase	activity	and	also	completely	abolish	the	ability	of	<RNA_Name>	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	luciferase	expression	
thus	we	have	demonstrate	for	the	first	time	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	examine	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	during	aec	trans-differentiation

all	together	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	at	both	protein	and	mrna	level	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	bind	to	the	predict	target	site	in	the	3'utr	of	its	mrna	
<RNA_Name>	target	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	
to	verify	a	direct	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	we	clone	the	3'utr	region	that	be	predict	to	interact	with	<RNA_Name>	into	a	luciferase	reporter	vector	
<RNA_Name>	b	target	and	inhibit	oncogenic	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	directly	transactivates	<RNA_Name>	in	parallel	with	its	host	gene	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	b	directly	targetand	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
these	loss-of-function	data	together	with	overexpression	data	demonstrate	the	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	result	provide	strong	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	target	and	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	through	directly	bind	to	their	3'-utrs	
finally	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	schizophrenia-	and	development-associated	gene	include	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
finally	we	demonstrate	that	several	gene	associate	with	neurodevelopment	in	mouse	and	schizophrenia	in	human	include	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
in	addition	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	inhibit	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	through	target	their	mrna	cod	sequence	respectively	
moreover	<RNA_Name>	increase	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	through	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	form	a	feedback	loop	of	<Protein_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	
as	expect	western	blot	analysis	show	that	the	exogenous	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	could	be	decrease	by	mirnas	in	the	cell	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	target	mrna	<Protein_Name>	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	target	mrna	<Protein_Name>	of	<Protein_Name>	
therefore	we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	<Number>	cluster	be	able	to	downregulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	in	breast	cancer	cell	
thus	we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	enhances	the	stability	of	<Protein_Name>	through	target	<Protein_Name>	mrna	<Protein_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	
hence	<RNA_Name>	be	a	direct	<Protein_Name>	transcriptional	target	of	<Protein_Name>	that	can	mediate	some	of	<Protein_Name>	's	biological	effect	
finally	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	and	<RNA_Name>	level	in	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	sample	be	assay	by	qrt-pcr	and	data	show	that	there	be	a	negative	correlation	between	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	and	<RNA_Name>	level

furthermore	we	show	the	interaction	of	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	with	cdk1-3'utr	by	luciferase	assay	
the	good	result	in	these	gain-	and	loss-of-function	study	obtain	with	the	association	of	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	argue	for	their	cooperation	in	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression

we	confirm	that	increased	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	result	in	the	translational	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	the	presence	or	absence	of	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	via	interaction	with	the	<Protein_Name>	3'-untranslated	region	
consistent	with	recent	report	that	<RNA_Name>	and	mir-29abc	targetthe	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	confirm	that	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	a	target	of	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	more	importantly	demonstrate	the	ability	of	these	mirnas	to	potently	modulate	tgf	--	beta-induced	change	in	<Protein_Name>	expression

we	clone	the	human	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	into	a	luciferase	reporter	plasmid	and	cotransfected	it	with	<RNA_Name>	into	lncap	and	pc-3m	cell	
these	finding	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	bind	to	its	3'utr	
these	data	demonstrate	that	bovine	<Protein_Name>	be	a	specific	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	mirnas	contribute	to	explain	additive	phenotypic	hypertrophy	in	piedmontese	cattle	select	for	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	mutation	possibly	outline	a	more	precise	genetic	signature	able	to	elucidate	difference	in	muscle	conformation	
co-transfection	of	pre-mir-142	with	the	wild-type	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	'	-utr	construct	do	not	alter	the	luciferase	activity	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	target	<Protein_Name>	
here	we	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	far	regulate	at	post-transcriptional	level	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	and	that	tanshinones	suppress	<Protein_Name>	by	regulate	the	expression	level	of	<RNA_Name>	and	other	interrelated	mirnas

in	addition	<Protein_Name>	be	identify	as	the	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	in	osteosarcoma	
all	these	result	indicate	<RNA_Name>	and	its	downstream	target	gene	<Protein_Name>	can	be	use	to	treat	osteosarcoma	chemoresistance	in	the	future	
in	conclusion	our	investigation	reveal	that	the	<RNA_Name>	affect	migration	invasion	and	chemoresistance	in	osteosarcoma	possibly	via	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	select	for	further	experimental	validation	because	the	complementary	sequence	of	<RNA_Name>	be	identify	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	by	miranda	analysis	
moreover	cotransfection	of	786-o	cell	with	the	wt	3'utr	and	<RNA_Name>	reverse	the	decrease	cause	by	<RNA_Name>	
expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	significantly	reduce	by	<RNA_Name>	transfection	and	increase	by	<RNA_Name>	transfection	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	cause	a	reduction	in	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	786-o	cell

interestingly	we	find	that	increased	level	of	<RNA_Name>	in	meningioma	cell	significantly	downregulated	-beta-catenin	at	both	mrna	and	protein	level	
these	data	strongly	suggest	that	the	reduce	-beta-catenin	level	in	pre-mir-200a-transfected	cell	be	a	result	of	direct	targeting	of	the	-beta-catenin	rna	by	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	data	suggest	that	among	<RNA_Name>	target	the	-beta-catenin	mrna	be	one	of	the	major	contributor	to	mir-200a-induced	apoptosis	
thus	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	a	sequence-specific	manner

next	we	determine	the	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	endogenous	human	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	use	<Protein_Name>	cell	
as	expect	ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	a	significant	reduction	of	human	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	in	addition	the	level	of	human	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	also	repress	by	<RNA_Name>	
overall	the	above	result	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	novel	targetgene	of	<RNA_Name>

these	finding	indicate	that	the	tumor-suppressor	<RNA_Name>	can	control	hcc	tumor	growth	partially	through	simultaneously	regulate	the	oncogenic	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
these	finding	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
the	serine	threonine	kinase	<Protein_Name>	an	amplifier	of	cell	apoptosis	seem	to	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	the	activation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	pathway	be	necessary	for	the	anti-apoptotic	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	
a	marked	increase	in	<Protein_Name>	phosphorylation	at	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	be	find	in	pasmcs	overexpressing	<RNA_Name>	which	be	block	by	co-transfection	with	amo-138	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	activates	<Protein_Name>	signal	by	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	
these	data	strongly	suggest	that	the	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	be	involve	in	the	suppression	of	pasmc	apoptosis	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	thus	suggest	that	the	mir-138-mediated	suppression	of	caspase-dependent	apoptosis	appear	to	target	at	<Protein_Name>

under	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	kinase	by	ly294002	the	suppressive	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	hcv	replication	be	abolish	indicate	that	suppression	of	hcv	replication	by	<RNA_Name>	be	dependent	on	the	<Protein_Name>	kinase	<Protein_Name>	pathway	
take	together	our	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	immunosuppressive	function	of	<Protein_Name>	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
experimental	validation	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	its	inhibition	block	inflammatory	and	catabolic	change	in	osteoarthritic	chondrocytes	
inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	in	osteoarthritic	chondrocytes	by	antisense	<RNA_Name>	treatment	highly	up-regulated	bmp-7	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	strong	regulator	of	bmp-7	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	
all	above	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	bmp-7	at	the	mrna	level	and	<Protein_Name>	at	the	protein	level	
we	report	here	that	bace1-antisense	prevents	mirna-induced	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	by	mask	the	binding	site	for	<RNA_Name>	
indeed	<RNA_Name>	and	bace1-antisense	compete	for	bind	within	the	same	region	in	the	open	reading	frame	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
our	result	indicate	that	mirna-binding	site	in	the	coding	part	of	mrna	may	still	be	functional	and	further	suggest	the	possibility	of	in	vivo	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	mature	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
simultaneous	over-expression	of	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	return	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	to	the	basal	level	
these	data	imply	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	may	compete	for	bind	to	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	support	the	novel	regulatory	role	of	mask	a	mirna-binding	site	in	<Protein_Name>	by	the	non-coding	<RNA_Name>	transcript	
the	high	concentration	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	the	brain	region	suggest	the	likelihood	of	their	functional	interaction	with	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	targetsite	and	involvement	in	<Protein_Name>	regulation	
mechanistically	we	show	that	<Protein_Name>	synergized	with	k1	to	induce	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	which	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	lead	to	nf-kappab	activation	
consequently	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	increase	<Protein_Name>	level	prevent	nuclear	translocation	of	nf-kappab	<Protein_Name>	and	ultimately	suppress	the	synergistic	effect	of	tat-	and	k1-induced	angiogenesis	
our	result	illustrate	that	by	target	<Protein_Name>	to	activate	the	nf-kappab	pathway	<RNA_Name>	mediates	<Protein_Name>	and	k1	synergistic	induction	of	angiogenesis	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
together	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	mediates	k1-	and	tat-induced	angiogenesis	by	target	<Protein_Name>	to	activate	the	nf-kappab	pathway	
<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	can	bind	the	same	sequence	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	thereby	modulate	its	expression	
through	simultaneous	regulation	over	<Protein_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	can	promote	gastric	cancer	cell	growth	and	invasion	
these	result	suggest	that	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	regulate	its	expression	
collectively	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	their	interaction	would	be	further	verify	in	a	rat	ir	model	
we	have	identify	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	and	functionally	modulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	both	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	condition	
in	this	study	we	carry	out	deletion	analysis	which	show	that	separate	domain	of	the	<Protein_Name>	rna	be	require	for	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
we	examine	<Protein_Name>	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	find	that	the	rna	inhibit	ribosome	binding	and	translation	by	pair	with	a	short	sequence	overlap	the	<Protein_Name>	ribosome-binding	site	
<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	reduce	both	mrna	and	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	which	stimulate	proliferation	and	suppressed	apoptosis	in	hcc	cell	
this	study	also	show	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	regulate	via	a	functional	microrna-204	binding	site	within	the	3'utr	
reciprocal	knockdown	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	level	be	perform	use	antisense	oligoribonucleotides	target	against	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	and	du145	cell	and	result	in	an	increase	in	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	while	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	remain	unchanged	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	mrna	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	most	likely	through	a	mechanism	of	translation	inhibition	
the	mrna	and	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	decrease	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	and	increase	with	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	treatment	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	k562	and	hl60	cell	
transfection	with	<Protein_Name>	expression	plasmid	increase	mrna	and	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	mimic	treatment	reverse	the	rbp2-overexpression-induced	<Protein_Name>	which	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	increase	<Protein_Name>	expression	via	<RNA_Name>	
the	sirnas	significantly	reduce	level	of	their	targetproteins	after	<Number>	h	and	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	mimic	also	lead	to	a	significant	reduction	in	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	within	the	same	time	frame	
conversely	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	cluster	mirnas	in	mcf-7	cell	by	transfection	of	microrna	hairpin	inhibitor	increase	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
these	finding	be	also	validate	at	the	mrna	level	upon	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	or	inhibition	confirm	mrna	degradation	mechanism	for	<RNA_Name>	targeting	of	these	two	gene	
in	conclusion	the	result	of	the	luciferase	assay	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	indeed	novel	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
this	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	might	also	contribute	to	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	breast	cancer	patient	
altogether	these	data	suggest	that	target	of	either	<Protein_Name>	or	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	contributes	to	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	migration-related	process	
here	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	down-regulate	hla-g	expression	by	bind	its	3'utr	and	that	this	down-regulation	of	hla-g	affect	<Protein_Name>	recognition	and	consequently	abolish	the	lilrb1-mediated	inhibition	of	nk	cell	kill	
<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	potentially	targetthe	3'utr	of	hla-g	
thus	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	targetthe	3'utr	of	hla-g	and	such	target	lead	to	hla-g	down-regulation	
these	result	indicate	that	the	predicted	binding	site	be	indeed	target	by	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	that	the	g	c	polymorphism	have	no	influence	on	mirna-mediated	target	despite	the	unusual	seed	match	
these	result	clearly	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	control	by	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	family	
these	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	a	-b	and	-c	control	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	result	suggest	that	the	downregulation	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	during	inflammation	be	accountable	of	the	<Protein_Name>	increase	expression	
these	result	show	that	during	inflammation	exogenous	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	control	<Protein_Name>	expression	
as	a	result	we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	may	have	a	crucial	role	in	repress	the	expression	of	caspase-3	which	may	contribute	to	a	low	apoptotic	rate	thus	support	the	selection	of	more	aggressive	cancer	cell	
to	our	knowledge	this	be	the	first	study	relate	to	the	expression	level	of	caspase-3	and	<RNA_Name>	in	different	cell	line	at	the	same	time	
we	expect	that	our	study	might	pave	the	way	for	good	understand	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	apoptotic	regulation	of	caspase-3	
here	we	report	that	glia-enriched	<RNA_Name>	a	microrna	that	be	dramatically	downregulated	in	malignant	glioma	and	correlate	with	the	pathological	grading	be	capable	of	induce	mitochondria-dependent	apoptosis	of	malignant	glioma	by	regulate	various	gene	include	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	well	as	affect	the	signal	pathway	downstream	
next	we	look	for	predict	<RNA_Name>	family	target	gene	that	might	play	a	role	in	hermaphrodite	fecundity	downstream	of	mir-35-41	
multiple	3-	utrs	have	be	annotate	for	the	sup-26	mrna	only	one	of	which	contain	the	<RNA_Name>	family	target	site	
for	sup-26	to	be	a	direct	<RNA_Name>	family	target	the	long	1146-bp	3'utr	must	be	use	
sup-26	also	suppress	the	appearance	of	endomitotic	oocyte	in	mir-35-41	sup-26

to	determine	whether	the	up-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	receptor	be	responsible	for	the	increase	proliferation	see	in	eosinophil	culture	derive	from	the	mir-223-	-	mouse	we	treat	eosinophil	culture	on	day	<Number>	with	<Number>	m	of	an	<Protein_Name>	receptor	inhibitor	-	picropodophyllin	or	an	equivalent	volume	of	dmso	as	a	control	
loss	of	autophagy	activity	suppress	developmental	defect	cause	by	partially	impaired	silencing	of	mirna	target	include	the	<RNA_Name>	family	and	<RNA_Name>	
thus	autophagy	activity	modulate	mirna-mediated	gene	silencing	and	degrade	a	core	mirisc	component	
these	result	suggest	that	the	complementary	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	target	of	mir-34a-mediated	post-transcriptional	gene	silence	
western	blot	analysis	of	sk-n-as	cell	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	show	a	signifcant	reduction	in	<Protein_Name>	protein	in	cell	overexpressing	<RNA_Name>	confirming	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
neither	the	construct	contain	the	putative	<Protein_Name>	targetsequence	or	a	<Number>	bp	fragment	of	the	3-utr	show	a	reduction	in	luciferase	activity	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	not	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>

and	the	inhibitory	effect	induce	by	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	or	<Protein_Name>	could	be	rescue	by	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	
transfection	with	anti-mir-16	inhibitor	suppress	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	counteract	the	egcg	effect	on	bcl-2	down-regulation	and	also	induction	of	apoptosis	in	cell	
we	deploy	a	microrna	sponge	strategy	to	inhibit	<RNA_Name>	in	vitro	and	the	result	demonstrate	that	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	receptor	contain	a	highly	conserve	mir-150-binding	motif	and	its	direct	interaction	with	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
<RNA_Name>	level	correlate	inversely	with	<Protein_Name>	in	breast	carcinoma	and	breast	cancer	cell	line	
thus	our	data	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	transcript	
<RNA_Name>	directly	target	the	3-utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	in	osteoblast

<RNA_Name>	represses	<Protein_Name>	translation	through	direct	interaction	with	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	via	its	3'-untranslated	region	whereas	point	mutation	of	<RNA_Name>	bind	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	prevents	mir-29b-	nduced	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	translation	
moreover	<RNA_Name>	directly	interact	with	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	via	its	3'utr	and	to	repress	<Protein_Name>	translation	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	interacts	with	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	via	its	3'utr	thus	repress	<Protein_Name>	translation	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	directly	to	the	3'utr	of	igf-1r	consequently	inhibit	igf-1r	expression	
<RNA_Name>	overexpression	result	in	the	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
as	illustrate	in	additional	file	<Number>	figure	s3	co-transfection	of	<Protein_Name>	<RNA_Name>	with	mature	<RNA_Name>	mimic	do	not	decrease	luciferase	activity	relative	to	the	negative	control	
negative	result	for	these	experiment	be	obtain	at	different	time	point	and	with	two	cell	line	indicate	that	either	the	<RNA_Name>	affect	on	<Protein_Name>	be	not	a	direct	effect	or	that	there	be	some	conformational	structural	difference	between	the	3'utr	of	the	reporter	versus	the	native	3'utr	which	inhibit	<RNA_Name>	targeting	of	the	reporter	
this	property	have	be	address	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	whose	rescued	expression	promote	medulloblastoma	cell	growth	arrest	and	apoptosis	while	target	the	proproliferative	truncate	<Protein_Name>	isoform	in	conclusion	misregulated	microrna	expression	profile	characterize	human	medulloblastomas	and	may	provide	potential	target	for	novel	therapeutic	strategy	
to	confirm	the	active	target	site	of	<RNA_Name>	the	<Number>	utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	clone	into	a	luciferase	reporter	vector	which	be	then	subject	to	target	mutagenesis	to	alter	the	seed	site	and	disrupt	<RNA_Name>	binding	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	t	cell	
in	addition	the	detection	of	<RNA_Name>	and	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	primary	gc	tissue	and	adjacent	im	tissue	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	be	inversely	correlate	with	<Protein_Name>	far	support	our	in	vitro	result	
the	reduction	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	organotypic	tissue	derive	from	hpv-containing	primary	human	keratinocytes	correlate	with	the	early	productive	phase	and	be	attribute	to	the	expression	of	viral	e6	which	destabilize	the	tumor	suppressor	<Protein_Name>	a	know	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	inhibits	cell	proliferation	and	invasion	and	enhance	paclitaxel-induced	apoptosis	in	nsclc	cell	at	least	in	part	by	directly	repress	<Protein_Name>	expression	
the	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	its	target	be	co-expressed	in	pancreatic	<Protein_Name>	structure	and	that	target	gene	expression	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	pancreatic	cancer	cell	line	sw1990	effectively	inhibit	both	endogenous	bcl-xl	and	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	
the	pattern	ofegr1	expression	be	the	opposite	of	the	<RNA_Name>	expression	pattern	follow	lps	induction	suggest	that	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	may	repressegr1	expression	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	both	on	mrna	and	protein	level	
take	together	the	above	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	repress	its	expression	mainly	by	bind	to	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	within	its	3'utr	but	<Protein_Name>	do	not	make	a	significant	contribution	to	<RNA_Name>	recognition	
these	observation	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	down-regulation	by	<RNA_Name>	as	in	<Protein_Name>	ablation	inhibit	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
d3	up-regulated	protein	<Number>	be	regulate	by	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	at	the	transcriptional	and	post-transcriptional	level	respectively	in	senescent	fibroblast	
to	verify	whether	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	a	dual-luciferase	reporter	system	be	use	by	co-transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	and	a	luciferase	reporter	plasmid	contain	the	3'utr	of	human	<Protein_Name>	
as	show	in	figure	5b	the	luciferase	activity	be	significantly	inhibit	by	<RNA_Name>	co-transfection	and	further	<RNA_Name>	fail	to	inhibit	the	expression	of	luciferase	construct	on	target	site	deletion	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
moreover	in	hcc	hep3b	and	smmc7721	cell	endogenous	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	transfection	far	proving	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	target	and	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	expression	
this	result	far	confirm	that	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	downregulation	may	participate	in	hcc	carcinogenesis	and	progression	through	potentiation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
this	result	further	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	suppress	hcc	cell	proliferation	at	least	partially	through	target	<Protein_Name>	expression	
<RNA_Name>	markedly	repress	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	pkcq	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	construct	
mutation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	target	site	abrogate	<RNA_Name>	associate	repression	in	luciferase	activity	suggest	a	direct	interaction	of	<RNA_Name>	with	these	site	
these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	several	key	gene	crucial	for	insulin	signaling	and	metabolism	of	lipid	and	glucose	include	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	pkcq	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
our	data	show	that	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	target	the	predicted	binding	site	within	the	nrp-2	mrna	3'utr	as	it	decrease	the	luciferase	in	9l	cell	transfected	with	a	luciferase	reporter	vector	contain	the	predict	binding	site	
western	blot	analysis	reveal	that	nrp-2	expression	be	significantly	decrease	by	<RNA_Name>	mimic	transfection	and	mmp-3	expression	be	significantly	decrease	by	<RNA_Name>	mimic	transfection	
co-transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	mimic	significantly	decrease	both	mmp-3	and	nrp-2	expression	
hese	data	show	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	their	respective	predict	bind	site	in	the	nrp-2	and	mmp-3	
a	guanine-to-cytosine	mutation	at	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	lead	to	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	by	disrupt	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	
this	indicated	potential	mir-570-mediated	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	finding	indicate	that	mir-570-mediated	repression	be	specific	to	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	
these	finding	suggest	that	the	mutation	in	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	directly	involve	in	posttranscriptional	regulation	mediate	by	<RNA_Name>	
furthermore	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	be	detect	by	rt-pcr	analysis	in	both	gastric	cancer	and	normal	tissue	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	be	involve	in	<Protein_Name>	translational	inhibition	in	summary	our	work	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	be	contribute	via	a	frequent	somatic	mutation	in	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	by	disrupt	posttranscriptional	and	translational	control	mediate	by	<RNA_Name>	
therefore	real-time	pcr	and	western	blot	analysis	be	perform	to	test	whether	<RNA_Name>	could	regulate	<Protein_Name>	
as	expect	mrna	and	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	reduce	in	hepg2	cell	with	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	
however	mutation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	target	site	abrogate	mir-361-5p-mediated	reduction	in	luciferase	activity	
cdc-27	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	its	downregulation	confer	increased	radioresistance	of	the	cell	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	regulate	its	expression	in	tnbc	cell	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	modulate	radiosensitivity	of	tnbc	cell	through	target	<Protein_Name>	in	this	study	we	verify	a	highly	conserve	putative	bind	site	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	tnbc	cancer	cell	
luciferase	assay	show	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	find	that	mir30a-5p	could	target	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	ectopic	<RNA_Name>	expression	with	special	mimic	could	degrade	its	protein	and	mrna	
we	also	find	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	<RNA_Name>	target	and	it	be	express	in	<Number>	<Number>	of	gastric	cancer	tissue	sample	
collectively	these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	may	be	a	potential	target	mediate	mir-506edependent	regulation	in	gastric	cancer	cell	
we	also	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	propose	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	the	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	be	verify	by	in-vitro	luciferase	assay	
these	data	confirm	the	direct	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
concordant	with	our	early	result	we	observe	that	the	over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	imim-pc2	cell	below	the	detection	limit	
far	our	result	for	the	first	time	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	confirm	that	both	subunit	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	finding	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	the	abnormally	low	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	could	potentially	lead	to	<Protein_Name>	protein	accumulation	in	ad	mouse	
so	among	these	hypothesize	mirnas	at	least	<RNA_Name>	may	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	level	
thus	<RNA_Name>	negatively	target	<Protein_Name>	in	the	3'utr	and	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	mrna	translation	which	in	turn	affect	<Protein_Name>	protein	translation	rather	than	degradation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
we	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	its	silence	together	with	that	of	c-myc	a	known	target	of	<RNA_Name>	contributes	to	resistance	to	apoptosis	induce	by	paclitaxel	through	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	
use	luciferase	reporter	assay	with	3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	over-expression	and	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
this	result	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
since	<RNA_Name>	be	down	regulate	in	sthdh	hdh	cell	it	be	expect	that	endogenous	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	would	be	high	in	these	cell	
expression	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	in	mrna	as	well	as	protein	level	be	decrease	in	sthdhq111	hdhq111	cell	express	exogenous	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	all	this	data	we	experimentally	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
bioinformatics	analysis	with	luciferase	reporter	assay	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	a	new	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	result	demonstrate	that	under	tensile	stress	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	adscs	osteogenic	differentiation	through	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	pathway	by	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
the	dual	luciferase	reporter	assay	in	<Number>	t	cell	and	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	reporter	assay	in	adscs	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	further	show	that	<RNA_Name>	post-transcriptionally	repress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	a	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	polycomb	group	protein	
furthermore	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	be	specific	because	mutate	the	seed	sequence	target	by	<RNA_Name>	within	the	luciferase-ezh2-3'utr	reporter	alleviate	mir-137-mediated	suppression	
together	these	data	demonstrate	that	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	be	repressive	post-transcriptional	and	specific	
importantly	they	also	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	context	of	adult	neurogenesis	
we	also	find	that	several	mirnas	suppress	sdf-1alpha	protein	expression	while	just	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	bound	to	the	sdf-1alpha	3'utr	
as	expect	mir-27a-	and	mir-27b-mediated	suppression	of	the	firey	renilla	luciferase	activity	be	abolish	when	we	mutate	the	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	the	sdf-1alpha-3'utr	suggesting	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	sdf-1alpha	translation	by	directly	bind	to	the	sdf-1alpha	3'utr	
thus	we	perform	mutation	assay	of	the	putative	binding	site	to	confirm	that	the	sdf-1alpha	3'utr	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	be	strongly	associate	with	both	a	high	<Protein_Name>	proliferation	index	and	presence	of	liver	metastasis	
western	blotting	show	that	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	significantly	elevate	in	snk-6	cell	with	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	it	be	conclude	that	reduction	in	<RNA_Name>	expression	can	inhibit	the	proliferation	of	snk-6	lymphoma	cell	and	promote	their	apoptosis	which	may	be	associate	with	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	gene	
<Protein_Name>	be	know	to	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	
rescue	<RNA_Name>	expression	also	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	n-cadherin	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	induces	e-cadherin	expression	both	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	
<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	molecular	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	that	<Protein_Name>	may	be	a	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	ec	cell	
our	in	vitro	study	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	therefore	we	examine	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	in	tumor	tissue	use	ihc	
<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	choose	for	further	analysis	base	on	their	reproducible	change	in	expression	after	infection	and	on	the	basis	of	have	predict	target	in	the	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	of	gene	encode	component	of	the	mammalian	target	of	rapamycin	pathway	which	be	important	during	hcmv	infection	
together	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	reduced	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
to	demonstrate	a	direct	interaction	between	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	with	<RNA_Name>	we	insert	the	3'utr	region	predict	to	interact	with	this	mirna	into	a	luciferase	vector	prl-tk	
a	<Number>	reduction	in	relative	luciferase	activity	be	observe	when	nih-3t3	cell	be	co-transfected	with	the	<RNA_Name>	precursor	and	the	reporter	plasmid	contain	the	3'utr	sequence	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'utr	sequence	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	vitro	
furthermore	<RNA_Name>	up-regulated	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	increased	apoptosis	in	colorectal	cancer	cell	line	
our	result	suggest	that	the	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	modulates	apoptosis	in	colorectal	cancer	cell	by	partially	repress	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	that	<RNA_Name>	could	be	a	potential	candidate	as	an	anti-cancer	drug	in	colorectal	cancer	therapy	
the	<RNA_Name>	polycistron	encodes	micro-rnas	which	decrease	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	regulate	proliferation	and	or	apoptosis	
lentiviral-mediated	overexpression	of	nkx2-5	in	the	t-all	cell	line	molt-4	consistently	result	in	increased	<RNA_Name>	pri-mirna	level	and	decrease	amount	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	
induction	of	apoptosis	by	treat	<RNA_Name>	or	<Protein_Name>	transduce	t-all	cell	with	etoposide	lead	to	reduce	or	enhance	cell	viability	respectively	
functionally	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	suppress	cell	apoptosis	by	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	in	ht-29	cell	
we	also	find	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'untranslated	region	of	il-10	transcript	
to	certify	the	possibility	that	il-10	be	regulate	posttranscriptionally	by	<RNA_Name>	we	construct	reporter	plasmid	by	amplify	the	mouseil-10	mrna	3'utr	and	clone	into	xbai	site	of	<Protein_Name>	vector	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	il-10	may	be	molecular	target	of	<RNA_Name>	posttranscriptional	repression	
so	this	result	indicate	that	lps-mediated	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	at	least	partially	involve	in	the	induction	of	lps	desensitization	via	up-regulation	of	il-10	
increase	<RNA_Name>	expression	result	in	a	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	antiapoptotic	myeloid	cell	leukemia	sequence	<Number>	protein	level	as	show	in	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	cell	of	adult	rat	expose	neonatally	to	eb	and	<Number>	in	spermatogonial	gc-1	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	
compare	with	scrambled	oligonucleotide	<RNA_Name>	transfection	have	a	clear	repressive	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	whereas	<RNA_Name>	transfection	have	no	significant	effect	in	down-regulating	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
the	most	marked	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	on	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	be	observe	for	<RNA_Name>	which	highly	reduce	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	as	well	as	to	a	less	extent	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	reduce	only	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	because	no	modification	be	observe	in	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
we	first	validate	whether	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	contain	a	putative	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	
to	test	whether	the	predicted	binding	site	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	could	mediate	repression	of	translation	by	<RNA_Name>	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	subcloned	downstream	of	the	luciferase	gene	in	the	<Protein_Name>	control	vector	
as	show	in	figure	3b	cell	that	be	transfected	with	the	reporter	construct	contain	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	have	significantly	low	luciferase	activity	after	the	cell	cotransfected	with	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	compare	to	cell	that	be	cotransfected	with	control	rna	
these	result	indicate	that	the	up-regulation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	target	gene	<Protein_Name>	be	essential	for	<Protein_Name>	accumulation	in	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	treat	<RNA_Name>	cell	
figure	<Number>	the	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	enhance	the	<Protein_Name>	stability	through	its	target	gene	<Protein_Name>	
figure	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	be	confirm	as	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
consistent	with	an	impairment	of	mirna-mediated	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	these	finding	prompt	us	to	investigate	the	regulatory	role	of	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	element	and	the	possible	involvement	of	specific	mirnas	in	cultured	neuronal	and	fibroblastic	cell	
through	various	experimental	approach	we	validate	computational	prediction	and	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	recognize	specific	bind	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	exert	regulatory	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	in	cultured	neuronal	cell	
a	bioinformatic	approach	reveal	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	result	support	a	potential	role	for	gsk3-beta	inhibitor-dependent	mirnas	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	reduction	of	endothelial	inflammation	via	direct	targeting	of	pro-inflammatory	mediator	such	as	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
among	the	possible	micrornas	find	to	be	upregulated	in	the	skeletal	muscle	tissue	of	mdx	compare	to	wt	mouse	we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	bind	the	3'utr	of	-beta1-syntrophin	and	participates	in	the	downregulation	of	-beta1-syntrophin	
thus	these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	express	in	skeletal	muscle	and	notably	upregulated	in	mdx	mouse	suggest	a	potential	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	downregulating	-beta1-syntrophin	expression	in	dystrophic	muscle	
this	result	strongly	suggest	an	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	the	3'utr	of	-beta1-syntrophin	
this	result	indicate	that	exogenous	<RNA_Name>	reduces	the	protein	level	of	endogenous	-beta1	<Protein_Name>	regardless	of	the	cell	origin	
take	together	these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	-beta1-syntrophin	protein	expression	and	silence	<RNA_Name>	can	restore	-beta1-syntrophin	protein	expression	to	normal	in	dystrophic	cell	in	culture	
the	toxin	decrease	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	which	correspond	with	an	increase	in	two	target	gene	cyclin	g1	and	the	cationic	amino	acid	transporter	cat-1	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	be	strongly	elevate	whereas	c-myb	a	transcription	factor	and	a	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	be	significantly	reduce	in	colon	tissue	after	<Protein_Name>	treatment	
interestingly	elevation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	down-regulation	of	c-myb	be	also	observe	in	human	colon	with	active	ulcerative	colitis	compare	to	the	normal	colon

in	summary	our	finding	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	reversely	regulate	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	target	its	mrna	3'utr	
take	together	the	above	study	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	play	a	role	in	the	emt	of	crc	by	inactivate	the	phosphorylation	of	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	via	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
mechanistic	investigation	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	a	large	number	of	cancer-associated	gene	include	the	apoptotic	caspase	<Protein_Name>

<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	by	target	irs-2	in	<Protein_Name>	a498	cell	
mechanistically	we	validate	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	find	that	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	significantly	decrease	phosphorylated	<Protein_Name>	and	i	balpha	the	pivotal	downstream	effector	of	<Protein_Name>	
to	our	knowledge	however	it	be	not	report	whether	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	glioma	cell	proliferation	and	induces	apoptosis	through	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
we	further	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	glioma	and	silencing	of	<Protein_Name>	may	mimic	the	above	anti-tumor	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	
moreover	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	thyroid	cancer	cell	be	due	at	least	partially	to	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
as	a	whole	these	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
together	these	data	implicate	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	functionally	relevant	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	thyroid	cancer	
here	we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	associate	with	its	effect

use	both	in	silico	prediction	and	western	blot	assay	we	find	the	previously	report	tumor	suppressive	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	in	crc	the	direct	interaction	between	them	be	confirm	by	3'utr	luciferase	reporter	gene	
these	result	suggest	<RNA_Name>	could	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	transcriptional	level	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	function	as	a	potent	tumor	suppressor	through	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
we	also	observe	an	inverse	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	crc	tissue	and	their	adjacent	normal	tissue	
however	our	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	upregulation	be	developmentally	regulate	to	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	upregulation	and	that	<RNA_Name>	significantly	escape	xci	our	data	argue	that	<RNA_Name>	be	an	activator	of	<RNA_Name>	therefore

transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	with	the	wild-type	utr-reporter	lead	to	a	significant	decrease	of	luciferase	activity	whereas	coexpression	of	the	antagomirs	of	<RNA_Name>	have	no	effect	on	the	reporter	activity	
and	western	blot	analysis	data	indicate	that	the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	the	down-regulation	of	bcl-w	at	the	mrna	and	protein	level

this	result	confirm	that	the	pro-apoptotic	function	of	<RNA_Name>	be	strictly	dependent	on	the	presence	of	mutate	<Protein_Name>	and	suggest	that	additional	mirna	target	may	be	involve	in	the	establishment	of	the	synthetic	lethal	phenotype	
in	addition	the	result	of	the	qpcr	and	western	blot	analysis	demonstrate	that	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	significantly	reduce	the	mrna	and	protein	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	hcc	cell	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	and	can	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>

<Protein_Name>	protein	be	significantly	decrease	after	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	suggest	that	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	the	number	of	postmitotic	neuron	and	neurite	elongation	might	be	mediate	by	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	the	percentage	of	postmitotic	neuron	be	not	mediate	by	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	support	the	observation	that	<RNA_Name>	may	modulate	neurite	outgrowth	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
importantly	a	similar	increase	in	acetylated	<Protein_Name>	be	observe	after	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	increase	<Protein_Name>	acetylation	and	subsequent	<Protein_Name>	transcriptional	activity	due	to	decreased	<Protein_Name>	expression

luciferase	reporter	assay	reveal	<Protein_Name>	as	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	on	the	wild-type	or	mutant	3'utr	sequence	of	<Protein_Name>	in	vsmcs	
our	study	have	show	that	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	may	contribute	to	b-glycerophosphate-induced	vsmc	calcification	through	regulating	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	play	a	negative	role	in	vsmc	calcification	through	down-regulating	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
in	conclusion	this	study	identify	<RNA_Name>	as	an	important	regulator	of	vsmc	function	by	repress	its	targetgene	<Protein_Name>	and	inhibit	medial	artery	calcification	in	vivo	which	represent	a	novel	mechanism	regulate	vascular	calcification	
then	luciferase	reporter	assay	be	perform	to	identify	whether	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	binding	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
this	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	indeed	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	a	significant	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	the	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	obviously	increase	the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
as	detect	by	western	blot	high	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	obviously	decrease	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	compare	to	the	control

western	blot	analysis	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	be	significantly	decrease	in	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	group	compare	with	that	of	the	control	group	while	<Protein_Name>	be	significantly	increase	in	the	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	group	
a	dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	demonstrate	that	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	bind	to	<RNA_Name>	and	western	blotting	analysis	far	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	down-regulated	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
great	than	<Number>	reduction	of	luciferase	activity	be	observe	with	wild-type	<Protein_Name>	and	<Number>	reduction	of	luciferase	activity	be	observe	with	wild-type	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	support	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	in	hek293a	have	no	interference	to	our	experience

take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	cyclin	d1	protein	level	in	breast	tumor	cell	
take	together	these	result	provide	evidence	that	cyclin	d1	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	to	at	least	one	site	within	the	cyclin	d1	3'utr	may	be	sufficient	to	reduce	cyclin	d1	protein	level	
a	luciferase	reporter	assay	show	a	significantly	decrease	signal	at	two	<RNA_Name>	targetsites	at	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	
the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	significantly	decrease	by	<RNA_Name>	transfection	in	both	pc	cell	line	
the	protein	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	also	markedly	reduce	in	the	pc	cell	line	after	<RNA_Name>	transfection	
the	luciferase	reporter	assay	confirm	that	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	contain	actual	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	summary	our	expression	profile	in	pc	cell	line	show	that	<Protein_Name>	can	have	an	oncogenic	function	and	that	<RNA_Name>	can	act	as	a	tumor	suppressor	through	the	direct	control	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
we	prepare	three	reporter	vector	target	by	<RNA_Name>	am147	3'utr	which	have	seven	repeat	of	<RNA_Name>	sponge	and	can	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	efficiently	http	3'utr	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	that	have	be	report	before35	and	ifn-gamma	3'utr	the	predicted	target	of	<RNA_Name>	that	we	verify	above

however	when	we	mutate	the	mir-29-binding	site	in	the	http	3'utr	vector	or	ifn-gamma	3'utr	vector	the	upregulation	of	luciferase	activity	in	gs29	macrophage	be	abolish	accordingly	
in	addition	we	observe	no	substantial	upregulation	of	the	luciferase	activity	of	a	control	3'utr	il-10	reporter	vector	in	gs29	macrophage	consistent	with	the	lack	of	mir-29-binding	site	in	the	3'utr	of	il-10	mrna

finally	analysis	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	level	in	nsclcs	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	inversely	correlate	with	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	
our	collective	finding	provide	preliminary	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	act	as	a	tumor	suppressor	in	nsclc	through	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	
base	on	these	finding	we	propose	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	bind	to	its	3'utr	region	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	our	study	show	that	tumor-suppressive	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	act	as	<Protein_Name>	repressor	in	summary	these	result	suggest	that	specific	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	family	member	be	involve	in	the	control	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	its	mrna	
this	downregulation	be	associate	with	a	reduction	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	suggest	that	transfected	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	mimic	induced	degradation	of	the	specific	mrna	though	an	impact	on	translation	could	not	be	exclude	
the	strong	inhibitory	effect	on	targetexpression	be	exert	by	<RNA_Name>	as	already	observe	in	reporter	gene	assay	in	summary	these	data	clearly	show	the	functional	significance	of	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	by	<RNA_Name>	
we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	be	significantly	down-regulated	in	<RNA_Name>	mimic	group	and	up-regulated	in	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	group	
besides	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	in	the	mouse	be	also	detect	as	show	in	<Protein_Name>

our	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	mediates	iso-induced	proliferation	and	collagen	synthesis	in	cf	by	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	and	activate	the	downstream	extracellular	signal-regulated	kinase-mitogen-activated	protein	kinase	signal	pathway	
the	outcome	show	that	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	not	affect	but	the	protein	level	be	correspondingly	decreased	or	increase	when	<RNA_Name>	be	overexpressed	or	downregulated	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	translational	inhibition	in	our	study	<Protein_Name>	be	find	to	decrease	in	fibrotic	rat	heart	tissue	and	fibroblast	and	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
therefore	<RNA_Name>	a-3p	directly	target	and	inhibits	mcl-1	and	bcl-xl	translation	
co-transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	a-3p	mimic	significantly	inhibit	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	mcl-1	and	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	but	do	not	affect	the	luciferase	activity	of	either	a	mcl-1	or	a	bcl-xl	reporter	with	mutated	<RNA_Name>	a-3p	binding	site	
<RNA_Name>	regulate	neural	stem	cell	proliferation	and	differentiation	by	target	the	stem	cell	regulator	<Protein_Name>	and	the	cell	cycle	regulator	cyclin	d1	
introduce	an	expression	vector	of	<Protein_Name>	or	cyclin	d1	that	lack	the	<RNA_Name>	recognition	site	rescue	let-7b-induced	proliferation	deficiency	suggest	that	both	<Protein_Name>	and	cyclin	d1	be	important	target	for	let-7b-mediated	regulation	of	neural	stem	cell	proliferation	
cyclin	d1	mrna	and	protein	level	be	both	reduce	in	the	wild	type	let-7b-transfected	cell	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	cyclin	d1	expression	in	neural	stem	cell	
<Protein_Name>	have	be	show	to	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	human	cell	but	the	mir-328-targeting	sequence	find	in	3'utr	of	human	<Protein_Name>	do	not	exist	in	3'utr	of	rat	<Protein_Name>	
the	highly	complementary	sequence	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	essential	for	<RNA_Name>	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
loss	of	<RNA_Name>	family	expression	and	concomitant	increase	in	the	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	occur	in	an	additional	all	cell	line	sup-b15	but	not	in	the	dexamethasone-resistant	reh	
here	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	indirectly	regulate	expression	of	the	pluripotent	stem	cell	marker	<Protein_Name>	and	it	directly	regulate	expression	of	cyclin	d2	protein	a	developmental	regulator	during	gastrulation	
our	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	play	an	important	role	in	maintain	the	pluripotency	of	ecc	and	probably	escs	by	post-transcriptional	regulation	of	cyclin	d2	expression	
these	data	indicate	that	there	be	a	strong	possibility	that	cyclin	d2	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	post-transcriptional	regulation	and	this	possibility	would	be	consistent	with	the	reciprocal	down-regulation	of	cyclin	d2	protein	
here	we	identify	fra-1	as	a	new	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	fra-1	expression	at	both	protein	and	messenger	rna	level	
cotransfection	experiment	show	that	<RNA_Name>	decrease	the	luciferase	activity	of	luc-fra-1	3'utr	but	have	a	minimal	effect	on	luc-fra-1-mut	3'utr	indicate	that	fra-1	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
western	blotting	analysis	show	that	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	significant	reduction	of	fra-1	protein	and	real-time	rt-pcr	analysis	indicate	that	fra-1	mrna	level	be	also	reduce	though	to	a	less	extent	
take	together	these	data	suggest	that	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	cell	migration	and	cell	invasion	be	in	part	mediate	by	fra-1	
<RNA_Name>	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	its	3'utr	
we	find	that	tumor	necrosis	factor-receptor-associated	factor	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	targetfor	<RNA_Name>	and	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	chme3	cell	decrease	<Protein_Name>	both	at	the	mrna	and	the	protein	level	
thus	our	result	suggest	a	novel	mirna	mediate	mechanism	for	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	human	microglial	cell	expose	to	hiv-1	<Protein_Name>	c	protein	
<Protein_Name>	protein	level	decrease	sharply	with	the	increase	in	tat-c	mediated	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	suggesting	that	<Protein_Name>	can	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	its	expression	can	be	modulate	by	change	in	<RNA_Name>	expression	
<RNA_Name>	downregulation	also	cause	increase	programmed	cell	death	and	a	decrease	in	the	expression	level	of	bcl-2	protein	although	<Protein_Name>	cleavage	be	not	affected	indicate	that	apoptosis	be	not	the	relevant	mechanism	underlie	the	observed	result	
treatment	with	antimir-21	cause	an	increase	in	the	autophagy	related	proteins	beclin-1	<Protein_Name>	and	lc3-ii

bcl-2	mrna	level	be	over-expressed	in	mir-192-suppressed	tumor	compare	with	control	
these	suggest	that	bcl-2	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
finally	find	that	only	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	could	be	decrease	by	<RNA_Name>	which	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>

these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	protein	translation	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	binding	to	the	3'utr	sequence	
together	these	experiment	show	that	<RNA_Name>	can	target	<Protein_Name>	lead	to	c-jun	accumulation	in	transformed	theileria-infected	leukocyte	
we	provide	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	which	lead	to	accumulation	of	the	c-jun	protein	and	increased	transcription	of	the	mir-155-encoding	<Protein_Name>	gene	
furthermore	cellular	mechanism	study	reveal	that	induction	of	<RNA_Name>	decrease	the	expression	of	notch-1	and	its	downstream	target	include	hes-1	cyclin	d1	survivin	and	bcl-2	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	target	evolutionarily	conserve	sequence	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	that	prevent	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	transcript	in	vivo	cause	abnormal	segmentation	and	perturbs	clock	activity	
mutation	of	predicted	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	at	either	end	of	the	mouse	3'utr	or	of	the	single	site	in	the	chicken	3'utr	abrogate	the	effect	of	exogenous	<RNA_Name>	indicating	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	interact	with	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	and	that	these	interaction	be	conserve	among	organism	that	utilize	<Protein_Name>	in	the	segmentation	clock	
overall	our	finding	be	consistent	with	a	model	wherein	block	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	chick	embryo	initially	result	in	stabilization	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	although	we	can	not	rule	out	that	this	interaction	may	also	affect	translational	efficiency	of	the	transcript	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	interfere	with	luciferase	mrna	translation	via	direct	interaction	with	rat	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
however	western	blot	assay	reveal	significantly	reduce	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	in	afs	transfected	with	psuper	<RNA_Name>	compare	with	control	
interestingly	<RNA_Name>	be	previously	find	to	be	significantly	downregulated	in	intercept	platelet	and	its	positive	correlation	with	<Protein_Name>	mrna	that	be	also	downregulated	in	intercept	platelet	may	suggest	a	regulatory	role	of	<RNA_Name>	for	this	gene	
a	complete	network	of	all	identify	mirna-mrna	interaction	pair	be	show	in	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	this	network	show	mirnas	associate	with	the	most	significantly	downregulated	mrna	in	intercept	platelet	
<Protein_Name>	be	predict	as	a	potential	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	base	on	mir-target	analysis	the	predicted	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	with	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	increase	when	mcf7	cell	be	treat	with	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	and	decrease	when	mda-mb-231	cell	be	treat	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	
luciferase	activity	be	significantly	increase	in	<RNA_Name>	deplete	mcf7	cell	whereas	it	be	decrease	in	<RNA_Name>	over-expressing	mda-mb-231	cell	compare	with	control	
<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	show	potential	role	of	tumour	suppressor	by	functional	analysis	of	bc	cell	such	as	cell	proliferation	apoptosis	migration	and	invasion	assay	
molecular	target	search	of	these	mirnas	show	that	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	be	directly	regulate	by	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
base	on	bioinformatic	analysis	the	sequence	of	mature	<RNA_Name>	match	the	3-	-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
the	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	significantly	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	prostate	cancer	cell	
<RNA_Name>	show	a	significant	suppressive	effect	on	the	firefly	luciferase	activity	compare	with	mir-nc	and	mock	control	
because	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	responsible	for	the	uptake	of	calcium	by	the	er	we	test	if	mir-708-5p-	and	metformin-induced	knockdown	of	<Protein_Name>	change	the	level	of	calcium	in	the	cytoplasm	and	the	reuptake	to	er	these	result	imply	that	metformin	and	<RNA_Name>	induce	apoptosis	and	er	stress	in	prostate	cancer	cell	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
in	comparison	to	the	control	a	significant	increase	in	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	be	associate	with	significantly	decrease	expression	of	bcl-2	<Protein_Name>	and	p-akt	and	a	significant	increase	in	the	apoptosis	rate	
analysis	of	pair	normal	tumor	tissue	from	additional	<Number>	patient	reveal	an	increase	in	<RNA_Name>	in	the	cancer	accompany	by	a	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
increase	<RNA_Name>	level	in	cell	by	<RNA_Name>	mimic	result	in	decreased	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	in	addition	<RNA_Name>	mimic	inhibited	luciferase	expression	in	luciferase	plasmid	reporter	that	include	predict	<RNA_Name>	recognition	sequence	from	<Protein_Name>	3'-untranslated	region	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	
this	study	demonstrate	a	novel	mechanism	of	post-transcriptional	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	identified	<RNA_Name>	as	a	marker	of	esophageal	cancer	
we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	uniquely	suppress	in	ebv	b	cell	line	from	<Protein_Name>	patient	and	that	the	3'untranslated	region	of	il-10	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	attenuates	il-10	production	and	increase	apoptosis	of	ebv	b	cell	lymphoma	line	in	contrast	a	vector	express	<RNA_Name>	which	be	modulate	by	ebv	but	be	not	predict	to	target	the	3'utr	of	il-10	have	no	effect	on	renilla	luciferase	expression	
furthermore	we	demonstrate	that	the	expression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	be	modulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	jurkat	cell	
therefore	we	conclude	that	the	inserted	fragment	of	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
thus	it	be	likely	that	<RNA_Name>	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	target	its	mrna	for	degradation	
next	we	obtain	direct	evidence	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	use	a	luciferase	reporter	assay	
our	study	provide	a	good	understanding	of	the	regulatory	capacity	of	<RNA_Name>	in	promote	ganglion	cell	dysplasia	by	target	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	the	rgc-5	cell	
validation	experiment	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	novel	functional	<RNA_Name>	target	within	the	3'utr	of	ratncx1	gene	we	identify	a	putative	mir-1-binding	sequence	that	be	highly	conserve	throughout	evolution	
<RNA_Name>	overexpression	in	cultured	cardiomyocytes	silence	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
indeed	luciferase	activity	be	decrease	by	more	than	<Number>	when	<RNA_Name>	be	overexpressed	confirm	the	direct	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	
program	cell	death	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	homology	delete	from	chromosome	<Number>	sprouty1	and	<Protein_Name>	be	the	current	identified	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	that	be	involve	in	mir-21-mediated	cardiovascular	effect	
<RNA_Name>	be	an	hfq-binding	small	antisense	rna	that	be	induce	upon	phosphosugar	stress	
it	form	a	ribonucleoprotein	complex	with	rnase	e	through	<Protein_Name>	to	mediate	silencing	of	the	target	<Protein_Name>	mrna	encode	the	membrane	component	of	the	glucose-specific	phosphoenolpyruvate	phosphotransferase	system	specific	
single	nucleotide	substitution	around	the	shine-dalgarno	sequence	of	<Protein_Name>	completely	eliminate	<RNA_Name>	action	while	compensatory	mutation	in	<RNA_Name>	restore	it	
a	systematic	mutational	analysis	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	rna	reveal	that	six	base	pair	around	sd	sequence	of	<Protein_Name>	be	particularly	important	for	<RNA_Name>	action	
they	also	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	reduce	cell	adhesion	cell	proliferation	cell	survival	and	endothelial	cell	activity	through	the	down	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
they	also	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	reduce	cell	invasion	endothelial	tube	formation	and	cell	survival	through	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	play	an	important	role	in	regulate	<Protein_Name>	effect	in	4t1	cell	
to	investigate	the	potential	involvement	of	c-myb	in	<RNA_Name>	mediate	inkt	cell	regulation	we	first	evaluate	c-myb	expression	in	thymus	immature	and	mature	inkt	cell	by	a	taqman	real-time	rt-pcr	
thus	during	inkt	cell	development	in	thymus	the	dynamic	expression	pattern	of	c-myb	be	in	mirror	contrast	with	that	of	<RNA_Name>	which	may	be	require	for	inkt	cell	maturation	
furthermore	c-myb	expression	be	significantly	upregulated	in	both	immature	and	mature	inkt	cell	from	mir-150ko	mouse	compare	with	that	in	wt	mouse	
thus	these	data	indicate	that	c-myb	may	serve	as	one	of	the	potential	target	in	mir-150-mediated	late-stage	inkt	cell	development	defect	in	the	thymus	
transfection	of	a	mimic	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	decrease	in	alkaline	<Protein_Name>	activity	and	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	caspase-3	
furthermore	dual	luciferase	reporter	assay	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	caspase-3	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
therefore	an	age-related	increase	in	<RNA_Name>	be	one	mechanism	by	which	<Protein_Name>	expression	could	be	regulate	in	an	ageing-dependent	manner	in	testis	from	old	male	
these	data	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	can	destabilize	<Protein_Name>	through	sequence	in	the	3'utr	
however	far	increase	the	level	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	a	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	expression	from	the	mutate	3'utr	indicate	that	other	putative	<RNA_Name>	seed	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	can	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	
use	an	online	microrna	target	database	wefound	<Protein_Name>	as	the	putative	target	of	<RNA_Name>	withcomplementary	3'utr	site	for	the	seed	sequence	ofmir-146a	
the	resultssuggested	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	directly	andconsequently	actived	<Protein_Name>	protein	which	exert	acritical	role	in	cell	apoptosis	
these	data	be	consistent	with	an	important	role	for	<Protein_Name>	downstream	of	<RNA_Name>	in	regulate	the	ability	of	the	dc	to	induce	a	functional	immune	response	
these	data	support	an	important	role	for	<Protein_Name>	as	a	critical	target	downstream	of	<RNA_Name>	in	regulate	dc	function	
rather	our	study	have	support	a	role	for	<Protein_Name>	in	regulate	dc	function	downstream	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	reduces	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	mrna	level	through	two	targetsites	within	the	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	
interestingly	analysis	by	quantitative	rt-pcr	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	be	also	capable	of	reduce	the	amount	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	suggest	that	it	suppress	gene	expression	through	mrna	degradation	
in	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	t	cell	in	aplastic	anemia	patient	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	up-regulated	and	prove	to	be	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	respectively	
<RNA_Name>	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	lead	to	an	increase	in	acetylated	<Protein_Name>	and	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	transcriptional	target	of	<Protein_Name>	that	regulate	the	cell	cycle	and	apoptosis	respectively	
in	contrast	<Protein_Name>	increase	pro-apoptotic	<Protein_Name>	post-transcriptionally	via	induction	of	endoplasmic	reticulum	stress	activation	of	inositol-requiring	enzyme	1alpha	and	suppression	of	<RNA_Name>	a	microrna	that	target	and	downregulates	<Protein_Name>	
most	importantly	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	blunt	<Protein_Name>	-induced	<Protein_Name>	expression	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	up-regulated	<Protein_Name>	expression	via	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	
combine	these	finding	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	induces	<Protein_Name>	expression	via	induction	of	er	stress	activation	of	ire1alpha	and	degradation	of	<RNA_Name>	
by	real-time	pcr	western	blot	analysis	and	mirna	mimic	and	3'utr-luctransfection	we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	that	the	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	lead	to	increase	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	pgk-1	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	and	in	human	tumor	tissue	specimen	
figure	<Number>	target	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
computerize	analysis	show	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	sequence	alignment	to	the	sequence	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
furthermore	use	real-time	rt-pcr	and	western	blot	analysis	we	observe	that	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	transfection	inhibit	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
via	luciferase	reporter	assay	we	confirm	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	target	
in	cultured	paafs	<RNA_Name>	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	while	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	increase	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	inversely	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	indeed	we	show	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	direct	target	of	these	mirnas	
in	contrast	when	<Protein_Name>	be	activate	in	myotubes	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	be	reduce	up	to	<Number>	fold	while	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	be	barely	affect	suggest	that	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	involve	translational	inhibition	mechanism	possibly	dependent	on	the	corresponding	increase	accumulation	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	
in	both	cell	type	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	result	in	a	partial	recovery	of	<Protein_Name>	accumulation	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	regulate	by	these	mirnas	in	myogenic	cell	
<RNA_Name>	which	target	the	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	downregulated	its	expression	
we	thereby	speculate	that	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	downregulated	<Protein_Name>	by	induce	mir-21-mediated	posttranscriptional	repression	
the	sequence	of	the	mature	mmu-mir-196a	and	-196b	be	the	same	as	those	of	the	hsa	<RNA_Name>	and	-196b	
a	schematic	diagram	of	the	mouse	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	indicate	the	location	of	the	authentic	<RNA_Name>	and	-196b	targetsites	that	be	conserve	in	vertebrate	
we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	level	be	significantly	reduce	by	treatment	with	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	in	hek293t	cell	and	that	<Protein_Name>	be	require	for	ar	mrna	stability	
on	the	basis	of	these	finding	we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	decrease	the	expression	level	of	ar	mrna	and	protein	by	silence	<Protein_Name>	a	protein	that	enhance	the	stability	of	ar	mrna	through	direct	binding	to	the	cug	triplet	repeat	sequence	in	exon	<Number>	of	the	ar	mrna	
here	we	show	that	acquire	<Protein_Name>	resistance	be	mediate	by	a	positive	feedback	loop	involve	the	nf-kappab	transcription	factor	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	their	respective	target	caspase-8	caspase-3	forkhead	box	o3a	and	<Protein_Name>	receptor-associated	factor	<Number>	
systematic	bioinformatics	analysis	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	and	its	3'utr	contains	potential	binding	site	for	<RNA_Name>	
one	recent	study	report	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	posttranscriptional	repression	
western	blot	analysis	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	mimic	significantly	reduce	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	in	macrophage	
the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	human	macrophage	significantly	reduce	luciferase	activity	for	the	wild-type	construct	but	no	alteration	in	luciferase	activity	be	detect	with	the	mutant	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	luciferase	reporter	plasmid	these	
result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibited	macrophage	apoptosis	through	the	direct	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	decreased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	both	miapaca-2	and	hs766t	
<Protein_Name>	expression	decrease	in	response	to	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	in	hs766t	but	not	miapaca-2	
to	test	the	functional	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	panc-1	cell	treat	with	or	without	<RNA_Name>	mimic	be	test	for	gemcitabine	sensitivity	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	gemcitabine	resistance	the	opposite	effect	of	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	
furthermore	western	blot	assay	show	that	vegf-a	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	which	be	verify	by	anti-ago2	co-immunoprecipitation	vegf-a	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
in	this	study	we	present	for	the	first	time	evidence	that	vegfr-3	can	be	negatively	cd	by	a	mirtron	hsa-mir-	<Number>	which	be	express	in	primary	human	lymphatic	endothelial	cell	
it	be	also	find	that	<RNA_Name>	could	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	posttranscriptional	level	via	a	specific	target	site	in	the	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	
thus	our	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	act	as	a	negative	regulator	of	c2c12	myoblast	proliferation	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	inhibited	<Protein_Name>	and	srebp-1c	expression	and	downregulated	their	targeted	gene	include	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
the	result	confirm	that	mrna	of	<Protein_Name>	be	straight	goal	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	inhibit	cholesterol	biosynthesis	and	fatty	acid	via	reduction	of	<Protein_Name>	and	lipogenic	or	cholesterogenic	transcription	factor	srebp-1c	and	their	low	regulate	gene	include	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	might	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	alternative	splice	form	through	pre-mrna	processing	
to	study	the	potential	regulation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	by	the	antisense	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	perform	in	jurkat	cell	
<RNA_Name>	directly	bound	to	<Protein_Name>	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	to	suppress	its	expression	as	measure	by	dual-luciferase	assay	
thus	ef24	keep	the	pro-metastatic	gene	<Protein_Name>	in	check	by	target	<RNA_Name>	in	consistent	with	western	blot	result	immunofluorescence	stain	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	knockdown	or	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	revert	ef24-induced	epithelial	differentiation	of	melanoma	cell	
these	data	imply	that	stress	<Protein_Name>	formation	and	focal	adhesion	assembly	be	locate	in	the	downstream	of	<Protein_Name>	transcription	which	can	be	suppress	by	ef24-upregulated	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	factor	such	as	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	the	repression	of	the	luciferase	reporter	by	<RNA_Name>	be	significantly	abrogate	in	all	three	case	indicate	a	direct	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	to	the	3'utr	sequence	of	the	respective	mrna	target	
<RNA_Name>	target	plasma	cell	delay	gc	transcription	factor	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
as	<RNA_Name>	be	the	most	abundant	mirna	in	mature	murine	and	human	bm	<Protein_Name>	it	could	also	play	a	pivotal	role	in	maintain	the	identity	and	life	<Protein_Name>	of	terminally	differentiate	<Protein_Name>	by	prevent	re-expression	of	<Protein_Name>	or	<Protein_Name>	and	reduce	the	abundance	of	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
a	search	for	<RNA_Name>	target	show	that	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	encode	the	cell	cycle	regulator	cyclin	e	contain	conserve	putative	<RNA_Name>	targetsites	in	its	mrna	3'utr	region	
targetgenes	of	<RNA_Name>	be	search	through	a	bioinformatical	approach	and	the	study	be	focus	on	cyclin	e	reporter	gene	assay	be	perform	to	confirm	that	cyclin	e	3'utr	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
noticeably	although	not	responsive	to	the	endogenous	change	of	<RNA_Name>	level	a	high	basal	luciferase	activity	be	observe	for	the	luc-3	'	<Protein_Name>	construct	as	compare	to	luc-3	'	<Number>	xt	or	ccne1-3'utr	add	further	evidence	for	a	negative	role	of	<RNA_Name>	response	site	on	cyclin	e	expression	
we	determine	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	relevant	target	of	<RNA_Name>	during	chondrogenesis	
these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	and	repress	its	expression	during	jnk-mediated	signaling	in	the	develop	chick	limb	bud	
our	finding	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	mrna	and	protein	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	quantify	in	the	renal	cancer	cell	follow	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	
moreover	co-expression	of	a	<Protein_Name>	cdna	lack	the	3'utr	be	able	to	suppress	<RNA_Name>	promotion	of	cell	invasion	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	silence	critically	mediate	mir-30d-	pro-migratory	effect	in	melanoma	
overall	our	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	data	support	<Protein_Name>	inhibition	as	a	key	contributor	of	mir-30d-	pro-metastatic	effect	in	melanoma	cell	
that	similar	glycosylation	change	be	induce	by	both	<RNA_Name>	upregulation	and	sigalnt7	and	be	restore	by	re-expressing	<Protein_Name>	support	the	key	contribution	of	<Protein_Name>	repression	to	mir-30d-associated	phenotype	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	30b	induce	il-10	at	least	in	part	by	repress	<Protein_Name>	reveal	an	unexpected	role	for	a	single	galnac	transferase	in	link	tumor	cell	invasion	and	immune	modulation

our	result	reveal	that	mirna-185	translationally	repress	<Protein_Name>	by	bind	to	its	3'-untranslated	region	
in	contrast	silencing	of	<RNA_Name>	use	a	specific	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	in	hek-293	and	skov3	cell	result	in	marked	induction	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
real-time	pcr	analysis	show	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	be	also	reduce	in	mir-185-overexpressing	cell	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	human	cancer	both	at	the	rna	and	protein	level

the	result	show	that	increase	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	decrease	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	expression	and	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	increase	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	expression	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	putative	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	repress	the	downstream	part	of	the	<Protein_Name>	polycistron	iscsua	without	affect	the	upstream	part	<Protein_Name>	
this	surprising	observation	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	induce	a	discoordination	in	the	iscrsua	polycistronic	transcript	which	result	in	specific	<Protein_Name>	expression	during	iron	depletion	this	
here	we	show	that	an	additional	isomer	of	mirna-125	translationally	arrest	mrna	of	the	<Protein_Name>	tumor	suppressor	gene	
the	basis	of	this	activity	be	the	high	degree	of	sequence	homology	between	the	seed	sequence	of	<RNA_Name>	and	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
2a	ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	have	no	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	as	quantify	by	real	time	pcr	thus	support	translational	inhibition	as	the	primary	mode	of	gene	silence	
<RNA_Name>	prove	almost	as	efficacious	as	specific	sirna	against	<Protein_Name>	in	reduce	protein	level	
<RNA_Name>	appear	to	targetedirectly	the	3'utr	of	both	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	result	in	significant	downregulation	of	protein	expression	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	do	not	affect	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	or	<Protein_Name>	
take	as	a	whole	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	exerts	a	direct	effect	on	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	that	ultimately	regulate	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
an	inverse	correlation	still	be	evident	in	the	remain	eight	case	highlight	the	inverse	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	and	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	in	crc	tumor	
take	as	a	whole	these	result	be	consistent	with	the	conclusion	that	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	mir-	<Number>	result	in	cellular	resistance	to	5-fu	
take	together	our	result	support	a	central	role	for	mir-21-dependent	down-regulation	of	the	hmsh2-hmsh6	heterodimer	<Protein_Name>	protein	in	5-fu	resistance	
the	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	elucidate	how	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	block	the	conversion	of	lc3-i	to	lc3-ii	and	thus	to	inhibit	autophagy	
<Protein_Name>	be	the	name	of	the	potential	targeted	gene	for	<RNA_Name>	in	glioma	
the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	might	be	a	negative	regulator	for	<Protein_Name>	
during	breast	cancer	cell	metastasis	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	be	downregulated	which	in	turn	contributes	to	enhance	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	invasion	
these	result	support	the	bioinformatic	prediction	that	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	might	be	a	direct	target	for	<RNA_Name>	and	denote	that	the	match	site	identify	strongly	contribute	to	the	mirna-mrna	interaction	mediate	the	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	data	be	functionally	relevant	and	further	reinforce	our	early	hypothesis	that	downregulated	<RNA_Name>	contribute	to	enhance	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	invasiveness	
these	finding	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	indeed	a	functionally	important	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	be	necessary	for	mir-193b-mediated	repression	of	proliferation	migration	and	invasion	
these	in	vivo	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	negative	regulator	for	<Protein_Name>	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	
thus	the	two	<RNA_Name>	targetsites	predict	in	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	3'utrs	be	sufficient	and	necessary	to	induce	the	mir-128-mediated	decrease	of	the	corresponding	protein	product	
the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	3'utrs	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	lead	us	to	hypothesize	that	the	observed	inverse	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	could	be	due	at	least	in	part	to	a	direct	regulatory	effect	exert	by	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
the	result	of	mir-128-overexpression	and	loss-of-function	experiment	be	complementary	and	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	
collectively	these	data	show	that	<RNA_Name>	target	macrophage	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	promote	thereduction	of	lung	inflammation	
these	data	display	an	inverse	relationship	between	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	putative	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
together	these	data	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	be	downregulated	by	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	
these	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	reduce	the	luciferase	activity	by	bind	to	cd64-	3'utr	but	have	no	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	mutant	3'utr	
therefore	we	conclude	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
specifically	we	identify	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
to	far	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	immunoprecipitation	of	biotinylated	<RNA_Name>	oligo	be	perform	on	homogenate	from	adult	mouseheart	follow	by	rna	extraction	and	pcr	analysis	for	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
consistent	with	the	precede	result	a	specific	pcr	signal	for	<Protein_Name>	be	obtain	which	be	absent	in	the	negative	control	in	addition	western	blot	analysis	of	<Number>	cell	transduce	with	admir1	reveal	a	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	upon	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	
all	together	these	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
for	the	purpose	of	the	current	study	the	obtain	result	confirm	an	inverse	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	suggest	the	presence	of	an	igf-1	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	signal	axis	
all	together	these	result	confirm	the	inverse	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	a	mousemodel	of	cardiac	pathology	
the	oncogenic	activity	of	<RNA_Name>	in	mda-mb-231	cell	be	due	in	part	to	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	myt-1	which	regulate	specificity	protein	transcription	factor	and	the	g2-m	chechpoint	in	mda-mb-231	breast	cancer	cell

when	we	determine	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	accord	the	relative	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	family	member	we	observe	that	the	cluster	<Number>	of	<RNA_Name>	show	a	negative	correlation	with	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	agreement	with	the	mechanism	previously	propose	by	<Protein_Name>	et	al	
we	find	that	bc	sample	characterize	by	increased	<Protein_Name>	expression	display	reduced	level	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	able	to	repress	the	expression	of	at	least	some	<RNA_Name>	family	member

brain-derived	neurotrophic	factor	be	normally	repress	by	a	conserved	noncoding	antisense	rna	transcript	<RNA_Name>	
as	one	example	we	show	that	brain-derived	neurotrophic	factor	be	under	the	control	of	a	conserved	noncoding	antisense	rna	transcript	<RNA_Name>	both	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	
these	finding	correspond	with	the	in	vitro	data	describe	above	and	indicate	that	the	blockade	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	the	increase	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	expression	in	vivo	
these	finding	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	level	in	vivo	
removal	or	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	could	lead	to	the	locus-specific	upregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	
our	finding	provide	the	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<Number>	be	critical	mediator	in	positive	circuit	for	pathogenesis	of	ibd	by	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	to	enhance	the	expression	of	inflammatory	cytokine	and	can	be	a	good	therapeutic	target	for	ibd	treatment	
through	bioinfomatic	and	biochemical	analysis	we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<Number>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	interaction	with	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	can	synergistically	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	post-transcriptional	level	by	target	3'utr	sequence	and	it	be	very	specific	process	for	trigger	intestinal	inflammation

the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	dramatically	reduce	compare	to	control	after	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	whereas	e-cadherin	expression	be	up-regulated	
the	predicted	<RNA_Name>	target	gene	include	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	which	be	key	breast	and	ovarian	cancer	gene	
breast	cancer	patient	who	have	at	least	one	<RNA_Name>	variant	allele	be	diagnose	at	an	early	age	than	with	no	variant	allele	and	ovarian	cancer	patient	who	have	at	least	one	<RNA_Name>	variant	allele	be	diagnose	young	than	woman	without	any	variant	allele	in	a	target	in	vitro	assay	we	observe	that	<RNA_Name>	could	bind	to	the	3'utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	potentially	modulate	their	mrna	expression	
intriguingly	the	binding	capacity	between	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	statistically	significantly	strong	in	variant	c-allele	than	those	in	common	g-allele	
take	together	our	data	suggest	that	breast	ovarian	cancer	patient	with	variant	c-allele	<RNA_Name>	may	have	high	level	of	mature	<RNA_Name>	and	that	these	variant	predispose	them	to	an	early	age	of	onset	of	familial	breast	and	ovarian	cancer	r	n	
our	data	also	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	and	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	insulin-secreting	cell	in	mice	<RNA_Name>	be	express	from	chromosome	<Number>	<Number>	and	<Number>	and	its	precursor	be	denote	as	pre-mir-9-1	pre-mir-9-2	and	pre-mir-9-3	respectively	to	indicate	the	locus	from	which	they	originate	
to	confirm	this	target	the	<RNA_Name>	bind	site	in	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	mutate	and	use	in	the	luciferase	assay	
these	result	clearly	show	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>

to	further	confirm	<Protein_Name>	modulation	by	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	clone	into	luciferase	vector	and	mrna	destabilization	assay	be	carry	out	
therefore	<Protein_Name>	be	a	real	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	our	system	
<RNA_Name>	overexpression	significantly	reduce	luciferase	activity	in	a	dose-dependent	manner	demonstrate	that	this	mirna	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
thus	<RNA_Name>	targeted	<Protein_Name>	and	negatively	regulate	its	expression	in	saccs	
thus	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
we	report	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	decrease	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	line	and	immunofluorescence	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	can	be	downregulated	by	<RNA_Name>	in	saccs	
the	use	of	the	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	markedly	reduce	the	inhibition	by	the	3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	suggest	that	the	<RNA_Name>	family	down-regulates	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
to	determine	the	inhibitory	effect	of	the	<RNA_Name>	micrornas	on	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	<Protein_Name>	the	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	be	introduce	into	<Protein_Name>	and	panc1	cell	
the	amount	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	not	significantly	affect	by	the	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	family	dominantly	target	<Protein_Name>	transcript	in	pancreatic	cancer	cell	
in	contrast	the	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	markedly	upregulated	<Protein_Name>	protein	level

moreover	the	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	contributes	to	the	aberrant	activation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	signaling	and	inhibits	cell	proliferation	and	invasion	through	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	repress	the	<Protein_Name>	pathway	through	target	and	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	
the	above	evidence	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	and	take	part	in	the	suppressive	of	mir-126-inhibition	proliferation	and	invasion

use	reporter	luciferase	assay	we	confirm	that	cyclin	d1	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	whereas	<RNA_Name>	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	be	indirect	
the	dual	luciferase	assay	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>

previous	study	show	that	inhibition	of	emt	by	<RNA_Name>	family	member	be	mediate	by	their	inhibition	of	the	expression	of	the	e-cadherin	repressor	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	through	bind	to	the	3'utr	region	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	-	<Number>	in	order	to	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	family	member	targetzeb1	and	<Protein_Name>	3'-utrs	we	co-transfected	either	zeb1-3'utr-luciferase	or	zeb2-3'utr-luciferase	reporter	vector	with	<RNA_Name>	family	precursor	in	hk-2	cell	
real	time	pcr	analysis	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	induce	in	a	time-dependent	manner	after	obstruction	an	effect	reverse	by	injection	of	<RNA_Name>	precursor	
although	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	do	not	cause	degradation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	it	do	however	reduce	the	activity	of	a	luciferase	reporter	gene	<Protein_Name>	to	the	wild-type	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	indicating	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	through	translational	inhibition	in	support	of	these	result	we	observe	a	clear	reduction	in	the	level	of	the	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	protein	in	<RNA_Name>	overexpressing	cell	
further	study	on	a	new	mechanism	of	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	show	a	significant	inverse	relationship	between	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	<Number>	which	be	upregulated	in	prostate	cancer	cell	line	
furthermore	the	luciferase	reporter	assay	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	predict	3'utr	target	site	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	
the	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	bind	to	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	induce	its	degradation	and	finally	downregulate	its	protein	level	in	primary	culture	neuron	
our	previous	study	find	that	<Protein_Name>	may	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	so	here	we	construct	wild-type	and	mutant	luciferase	reporter	plasmid	accord	to	the	predict	<RNA_Name>	bind	site	on	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
the	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	finding	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	could	inhibit	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	knockdown	would	far	affect	the	migration	ability	of	k1	cell	
indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	can	inhibit	the	expression	of	rock-1	in	k1	cell	
we	far	identify	<RNA_Name>	as	a	metastasis	suppressor	of	hcc	and	<Protein_Name>	which	be	an	oncogene	involve	in	different	type	of	cancer	as	a	direct	and	functional	target	for	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	cell	
bioinformatics	western	blot	analysis	and	luciferase	reporter	assay	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	all	above	support	that	<RNA_Name>	attenuate	osteoblast	differentiation	via	suppression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	downstream	pathway	
result	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	to	reverse	the	hydrosalpinx-induced	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	to	attenuate	the	impairment	of	embryo	attachment	in	vitro	in	the	present	study	we	identify	<RNA_Name>	as	an	inflammatory	microrna	that	contribute	to	endometrial	receptivity	and	embryo	attachment	by	suppress	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	increase	<Protein_Name>	expression	
our	target	analysis	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	mir-133b-mediated	<Protein_Name>	expression	consistent	with	a	previous	report	that	increase	<Protein_Name>	activity	in	the	endometrium	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	interfere	with	embryo	implantation	
western	blot	assay	show	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	its	downstream	signal	protein	expression	in	addition	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	have	similar	effect	with	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	on	eoc	cell	and	overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	effectively	rescue	the	inhibition	of	overexpressed	<RNA_Name>	in	eoc	cell	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	function	as	a	tumor	suppressor	in	eoc	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	apparently	specify	a	non-coding	rna	molecule	that	be	antisense	to	<Protein_Name>	an	arrangement	that	have	be	observe	at	other	locus	where	it	be	think	that	the	antisense	rna	be	involve	in	regulate	expression	of	the	sense	gene	the

<RNA_Name>	transcript	be	most	abundant	in	heart	where	specie	of	<Number>	<Number>	kb	and	of	<Number>	<Number>	and	<Number>	<Number>	kb	be	present	
therefore	the	data	also	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	4d	be	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	ovarian	cancer	cell	
therefore	our	data	also	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	4d	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	be	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	as	further	prove	in	luciferase	activity	assay	
those	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	4d	expression	via	direct	binding	to	putative	site	in	the	3'utr	region	of	<Protein_Name>	4d	mrna	
the	luciferase	assay	far	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	4d	mrna	expression	through	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	atthe	3'utr	region	of	<Protein_Name>	4d	mrna	in	skov-3	cell	
luciferase	reporter	assay	reveal	that	iq	motif	contain	<Protein_Name>	activate	protein	<Number>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	its	3'utr	in	this	study	we	first	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	expression	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	be	also	increase	in	response	to	stress	induce	by	serum	withdrawal	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	upregulation	can	occur	due	to	nutritional	stress	
<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	identify	to	be	potential	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	
collectively	these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	associate	with	the	mrna	3'utr	region	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	transcript	thereby	identify	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	bona	fide	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
here	we	show	that	stable	nucleic-acid-lipid	particle	carry	mature	<RNA_Name>	can	target	<Protein_Name>	in	vitro	and	show	equal	effect	to	those	of	adenovirus	<RNA_Name>	cell	infection	
moreover	we	find	that	three	mirna	family	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	control	the	mitochondrial	apoptotic	machinery	by	fine-tune	the	level	of	expression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	<Protein_Name>	
these	finding	suggest	an	undescribed	regulatory	pathway	in	cervical	cancer	by	which	<Protein_Name>	directly	induce	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	which	inhibit	its	direct	target	<Protein_Name>	lead	to	suppression	of	cervical	cancer	cell	apoptosis	
the	mir-126-	3p	sponge	neutralise	the	downregulatory	effect	induce	by	platelet	mp	on	the	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	whereas	the	empty	vector	control	sponge	do	not	
these	result	support	a	role	for	platelet	mp-derived	mir-126-	3p	in	regulate	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	the	mrna	level	
down-regulation	of	the	target	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	be	validate	by	luciferase	reporter	assay	and	western	blot	analysis	
therefore	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	repress	these	target	via	the	predicted	binding	site	in	our	study	four	host	cellular	gene	be	demonstrate	to	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	by	luciferase	assay	and	western	blot	
here	we	demonstrate	that	the	muscle-specific	mirnas	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	targetpax3	
the	pattern	suggest	a	possible	role	for	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	in	the	complete	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	within	the	myotome	and	limb	muscle	mass	follow	myoblast	commitment	
consistent	with	this	ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	dorsomedial	dermomyotome	lead	to	localized	loss	of	<Protein_Name>	
dual-luciferase	assay	show	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	directly	targetthe	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	through	both	predict	targetsites	
thus	antagomir	injection	and	pax3-specific	<Protein_Name>	result	in	similar	phenotype	indicate	that	efficient	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	be	crucial	for	timely	progression	of	myogenic	differentiation	
thus	<Protein_Name>	be	a	<RNA_Name>	target	gene	that	bind	to	<RNA_Name>	through	noncanonical	5'-	utr	and	<Protein_Name>	mres	
thus	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	modulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	post-transcriptionally	both	negatively	and	positively	via	direct	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	and	indirect	enhancement	of	<Protein_Name>	stability	
consistent	with	the	array	many	transcript	be	target	by	mir-	140-	5p	with	<Protein_Name>	the	most	susceptible	to	overexpression	of	mir-	140-	5p	while	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	upregulated	most	by	inhibition	of	mir-	140-	5p	and	therefore	the	predominant	target	of	endogenous	mir-	140-	5p	to	assess	which	of	these	candidate	gene	be	directly	target	by	mir-	140-	5p	we	clone	the	3-	untranslated	region	of	the	most	regulated	candidate	for	luciferase	assay

although	the	mature	sequence	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	be	completely	identical	we	generate	both	<RNA_Name>	and	mir-	196a-2	stable	transfected	cell	clone	to	exclude	homologuespecific	effect	on	the	targetgene	hox-c8	
hence	re-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	melanoma	cell	lead	to	a	silencing	of	transcription	factor	hox-c8	this	point	to	the	presence	of	additional	sequence	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	which	be	functionally	active	in	the	<RNA_Name>	mediate	regulation	of	hox-c8	expression

furthermore	we	identify	and	validate	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	identify	the	downstream	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	confirm	that	it	regulate	<Protein_Name>	cell	proliferation	cell	cycle	wound	heal	potential	and	invasion	metastasis	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	finding	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	bind	to	its	3'utr

thus	the	seed	sequence	<Number>	<Number>	represent	the	specific	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	be	responsible	for	mir-206-mediated	timp-3	down-regulation	
bioinformatics	couple	with	luciferase	and	western	blot	assay	also	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	glioma	cell	proliferation	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	regulate	cell	cycle

our	data	show	that	<RNA_Name>	interacts	with	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	bind	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	probably	through	specific	interaction	with	the	putative	site	at	<Protein_Name>	's	3'utr	and	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	targetfor	<RNA_Name>	
as	show	in	<Protein_Name>	2c	over-expression	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	a	significant	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	protein	compare	with	the	control	
therefore	we	conclude	<RNA_Name>	play	a	critical	role	in	<Protein_Name>	expression	
this	data	suggest	the	function	of	<RNA_Name>	in	melanoma	be	at	least	in	part	through	its	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>

our	result	demonstrate	that	the	mimic	of	<RNA_Name>	-30b	-30c	-30d	and	-30e	could	significantly	inhibit	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	wild-type	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	but	not	that	of	the	mutant	reporter	with	mutate	mir-30-binding	site

egfp	fluorescence	reporter	vector	analysis	show	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
this	study	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	might	influence	cell	proliferation	and	apoptosis	in	the	endometrium	by	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	could	also	influence	the	number	of	embryo	implantation	site	
this	result	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	stromal	cell	
all	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	protein	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	stromal	cell	and	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>

<RNA_Name>	inhibits	tgf-beta1-induced	apoptosis	by	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	human	hepatocellular	carcinoma	cell	
collectively	our	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	both	act	as	tumor	suppressor	by	target	the	prl-3	oncogene	and	inhibit	gastric	cancer	cell	migration	and	invasion	
<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	inhibit	the	migration	and	invasion	of	human	gastric	cancer	cell	by	directly	interact	with	prl-3	
qrt-pcr	also	show	that	prl-3	mrna	level	be	similarly	affect	at	<Number>	h	post-transfection	suggesting	that	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	suppress	prl-3	gene	expression	through	bind	3'utr	by	inhibit	translation	or	cause	mrna	instability	
these	data	together	with	previous	observation	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	increase	in	the	liver	of	mir-122-depleted	mouse	lead	us	to	hypothesize	that	<RNA_Name>	could	be	involve	in	maintain	iron	homeostasis	
take	together	these	data	show	that	the	3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>

in	silico	analysis	identify	a	sequence	in	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	mmp-13	mrna	complementary	to	the	seed	sequence	of	microrna-27b	
a	strong	correlation	between	the	level	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	mmp-13	protein	secretion	be	observe	at	later	time	point	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	bindhe	seed	sequence	present	in	the	3'utr	of	human	mmp-13	mrna	
take	together	these	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	3-	utrs	
we	conclude	that	the	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	in	hescs	be	sufficient	to	repress	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	directly	
these	result	indicate	that	the	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	exerts	more	repression	on	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	than	on	<Protein_Name>	during	hesc	differentiation	
the	reduction	of	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	indicate	that	these	endogenous	reprogramming	factor	be	posttranscriptionally	control	by	<RNA_Name>	in	hescs	
we	next	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	<Protein_Name>	3'-untranslated	region	
despite	repress	the	activity	of	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	and	mrna	level	<RNA_Name>	do	not	significantly	reduce	<Protein_Name>	protein	abundance	
these	data	be	consistent	with	the	hypothesis	that	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	modulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	
together	data	from	these	experiment	support	the	concept	that	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	can	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	sufficiently	to	potentiate	cyclin	e	activity	in	primary	fibroblast	
thus	we	propose	that	<RNA_Name>	be	part	of	a	feedback	loop	connect	cyclin	e	activity	to	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
mutation	of	the	two	nucleotide	within	the	predicted	target	site	for	<RNA_Name>	in	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	significantly	weaken	the	ability	of	<RNA_Name>	to	suppress	the	luciferase	activity	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	target	the	predicted	seed	sequence	in	the	3'utr	of	the	apcmrna	to	suppress	the	translation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	effectively	target	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	reduce	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	the	cell	include	the	human	breast	cancer	cell	
these	result	suggest	that	the	activation	of	canonical	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	by	<RNA_Name>	be	mostly	mediate	by	the	ability	of	<RNA_Name>	to	reduce	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	may	function	as	an	antiapoptotic	mirna	in	<RNA_Name>	cell	
inhibit	<RNA_Name>	expression	could	induce	<RNA_Name>	cell	apoptosis	via	caspase-9	and	<Number>	activation	but	not	<Protein_Name>	activation	
<RNA_Name>	represses	estrogen	er-independent	breast	cancer	cell	proliferation	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
the	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	estrogen	independent	breast	cancer	cell	growth	appear	to	be	due	to	translational	regulation	of	two	important	player	in	this	pathway	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
a	recent	report	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	at	the	translational	level	
by	careful	examination	of	<Protein_Name>	coding	and	noncoding	3'utr	we	find	only	one	<RNA_Name>	recognition	site	
therefore	there	be	a	possibility	that	<RNA_Name>	may	not	directly	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	but	rather	have	an	indirect	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	activity	
this	observation	far	establish	that	<RNA_Name>	could	directly	inhibit	the	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	albeit	less	effectively	than	the	reduction	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	the	negative	influence	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	be	both	directly	and	indirectly	due	to	<Protein_Name>	downregulation	at	least	in	breast	cancer	cell	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
this	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	specifically	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	
western	blot	analysis	reveal	that	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	suppressed	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	the	protein	level	
to	determine	whether	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	affect	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	we	carry	out	real-time	rt-pcr	analysis	for	the	same	cell	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	find	that	these	two	micrornas	have	no	effect	on	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	suggest	that	they	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	mainly	through	translation	repression	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	for	<RNA_Name>	
after	transfection	of	293t	cell	with	this	reporter	construct	along	with	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	we	find	that	both	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	luciferase	activity	by	about	<Number>	compare	with	the	vector	control	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	for	these	two	micrornas	
we	find	that	both	the	alpha-	and	-beta-isoforms	of	the	calcineurin	catalytic	subunit	be	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	cardiomyocyte	apoptosis	through	its	suppression	of	calcineurin-mediated	dephosphorylation	of	dynamin-related	protein-1	thereby	decrease	<Protein_Name>	accumulation	in	mitochondrion	and	drp1-mediated	activation	of	the	mitochondrial	fission	program	
we	discover	autophagy	protein	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	as	cellular	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
in	this	study	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	could	decrease	human	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	the	mrna	and	the	protein	level	through	binding	to	the	3-	-untranslated	region	of	halk4	mrna	and	interfere	with	<Protein_Name>	signal	
furthermore	the	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	reporter	expression	be	dose-dependent	but	increase	concentration	of	<RNA_Name>	have	no	effect	on	luciferase	activity	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	specifically	target	the	halk4	3'utr	
we	then	identify	<Protein_Name>	a	ubiquitously	expressed	<Protein_Name>	as	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	that	be	responsible	for	enhance	type	i	<Protein_Name>	response	
finally	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	induce	by	type	i	<Protein_Name>	in	rmcs	
therefore	we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	positively	regulate	the	type	i	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	in	human	rmcs	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
specifically	we	evaluate	the	expression	of	crucial	prosurvival	proteins	bcl-2	and	bcl-xl	as	their	3'-utrs	be	wellcharacterized	target	of	the	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	family	respectively	<Number>	<Number>	
these	data	provide	direct	evidence	that	the	decrease	in	bcl-2	or	bcl-xl	expression	follow	hdaci	be	due	to	an	upregulation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	family	respectively	that	bind	and	promote	their	downregulation	
therefore	block	the	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	family	from	bind	bcl-2	or	bcl-xl	in	breast	cancer	cell	prevent	the	downregulation	of	bcl-2	and	bcl-xl	and	blunt	the	apoptotic	response	result	from	hdaci

these	result	indicate	that	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	tca8113	cell

the	observed	coordinated	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	might	be	an	indication	that	fatty	acid-mediated	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	in	caco-2	cell	could	be	accompany	by	a	downregulation	of	gene	expression	of	apoptosis-inducing	regulatory	protein	whereas	gene	expression	of	apoptosis-inhibiting	regulator	such	as	bcl-2	and	bcl-xl	might	be	not	directly	affect	by	reduced	<RNA_Name>	gene	expression

these	finding	lead	us	to	hypothesize	that	<RNA_Name>	induction	by	chemotherapy	may	function	to	induce	chemoresistance	through	feedback	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	as	predict	by	this	model	transfection	of	a	<RNA_Name>	mimic	suppress	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	mrna	level	4a	while	expression	of	a	specific	antagomir	cause	an	increase	in	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	both	human	and	murine	cell	
most	notably	the	antagomir	experiment	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	constitutive	inhibitor	of	<Protein_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	
here	we	report	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	pro-hypertrophic	mirna	and	its	expression	be	regulate	by	the	transcription	factor	nuclear	factor	of	activated	t	cell	
knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	could	attenuate	hypertrophy	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	convey	the	hypertrophic	signal	
in	explore	the	molecular	mechanism	by	which	<RNA_Name>	be	up-regulated	we	identify	that	<Protein_Name>	could	directly	activate	<RNA_Name>	expression	through	the	transcriptional	machinery	
use	lentiviral-mediated	mirna	expression	we	show	a	significant	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	both	at	mrna	and	protein	level	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	respectively

an	igf-ir	resistant	to	<RNA_Name>	be	not	down-regulated	by	<RNA_Name>	but	fail	to	rescue	colon	cancer	cell	from	growth	inhibition	
these	and	other	result	take	together	indicate	that	down-regulation	of	irs-1	play	a	significant	role	in	the	tumor	suppressor	activity	of	<RNA_Name>	
long	non-coding	rna	<RNA_Name>	promote	breast	tumor	growth	by	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>

the	normalized	luciferase	activity	increase	by	<Number>	in	pis0-timp3-3'utr	transfected	cell	but	not	in	pis0-timp3-3'utrdelta	expressing	cell	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	interact	with	its	3'utr	
take	together	these	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	cell	
in	response	to	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	in	both	hngc-2	and	nsg-k16	cell	there	be	a	significant	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	at	protein	level	indicate	it	to	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
next	by	luciferase	reporter	assay	we	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	glioma	cell	
our	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	bound	to	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	suppress	the	luciferase	activity	in	hngc-2	and	nsg-k16	cell	
this	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	in	glioma	stem	cell	
these	experiment	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	glioma	stem	cell	
the	expression	of	e-cadherin	be	significantly	upregulated	whereas	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	significantly	downregulated	in	both	mir-203-expressing	skov3	and	ovcar3	cell	when	compare	to	control	cell	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	reduce	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	result	in	increase	of	e-cadherin	level	and	decrease	of	<Protein_Name>	level	in	hcclm3	cell	in	contrast	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	increase	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	lead	to	decrease	of	e-cadherin	expression	and	increase	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
a	dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	be	perform	to	disclose	whether	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
as	expect	<RNA_Name>	obviously	reduce	the	luciferase	activity	of	<Protein_Name>	contain	a	wt	3'utr	
our	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	hcc	
<RNA_Name>	inhibits	invasion	and	metastasis	of	gastric	cancer	by	target	the	<Protein_Name>	receptor	
decrease	<RNA_Name>	level	eliminate	<Protein_Name>	repression	which	activate	the	slit-robo1	pathway	through	the	interaction	between	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	thus	trigger	tumor	metastasis	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	gc	metastasis	
the	result	show	a	negative	correlation	between	the	level	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	these	cell	
furthermore	we	observe	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	level	be	decrease	when	<RNA_Name>	be	express	by	pgenesil-1-mir-218	in	mkn28-m	cell	
therefore	we	conclude	that	the	inserted	fragment	of	<Protein_Name>	be	the	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	have	be	show	to	function	by	directly	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	its	targetgene	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	bind	to	its	3'utr	
the	result	show	that	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	trivially	suppress	and	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	obviously	suppress	in	huvecs	transfected	with	the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	
we	use	a	luciferase	experiment	to	identify	that	<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	bind	to	its	3'utr	
apoptosis	can	be	trigger	by	deplete	<RNA_Name>	or	induce	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	in	lung	cancer	cell	line	
to	identify	mirnas	that	targetegfr	we	perform	a	bioinformatics	analysis	and	find	that	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	expression	in	human	lung	cancer	cell	in	contrast	mirna-542-5p	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	by	a	different	mechanism-down-regulating	its	level	by	bind	to	the	5'-utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
therefore	the	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	mirna-542-5p	should	not	be	affect	by	mutation	in	the	coding	sequence	
agent	such	as	<RNA_Name>	that	down-regulate	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	as	well	as	some	of	its	signal	effector	may	have	significant	therapeutic	potential	in	a	range	of	human	cancer	type	
we	also	identify	a	novel	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	find	that	its	regulation	modulate	the	invasion	potential	of	glioma	
the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	affect	the	aggressive	and	invasive	feature	of	gb-ns	as	confirm	by	a	great	differentiation	of	the	tumor	phenotype	and	a	highly	significant	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	support	the	concept	that	<RNA_Name>	play	an	important	role	in	glioblastoma	invasiveness	by	regulate	<Protein_Name>	
together	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	down-regulates	<RNA_Name>	form	a	double-negative	feedback	loop	in	gb-ns	
altogether	these	result	show	that	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	upregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	which	subsequently	reduce	<Protein_Name>	phosphorylation	
measure	gene	predict	to	regulate	apoptosis	and	autophagy	<RNA_Name>	mimic	decrease	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	at	both	messenger	rna	and	protein	level	and	reduced	mrna	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	and	protein	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
furthermore	we	detect	<RNA_Name>	repressed	expression	of	anti-apoptotic	factor	mcl-1	and	bcl-2	in	npc	tissue	and	cell	line	
western	blotting	show	that	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	associate	with	increased	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	a	subunit	of	protein	<Protein_Name>	2a	which	result	in	reduced	expression	of	phospho-akt	
<RNA_Name>	impact	on	<Protein_Name>	repair	pathway	
the	comparison	in	gscs	between	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	the	protein	level	of	the	three	target	show	an	inverse	correlation	thus	support	the	hypothesis	that	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	-beta	be	indeed	<RNA_Name>	target	in	gscs	
these	result	strongly	support	a	direct	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	as	previously	demonstrate	for	the	other	two	target	<Protein_Name>	and	gsk3-beta	
<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	activity	of	luciferase	when	thereporter	gene	be	link	to	a	3'utr	segment	of	<Protein_Name>

our	data	strongly	suggest	that	myocardial	fibrosis	could	be	modulate	not	only	by	<RNA_Name>	which	be	express	in	the	fibroblast	but	also	by	<RNA_Name>	muscle	specific	through	a	synergic	action	on	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	
in	vivo	myocardial	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	could	represent	a	regulatory	mechanism	that	contribute	to	heart	injury	lead	to	myocardial	fibrosis	through	an	increase	in	<Protein_Name>	expression	
consistently	<RNA_Name>	mimic	reduce	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	luciferase	activity	which	can	berescued	by	mutate	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	on	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	the	reporterconstruct	
far	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	restore	by	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	consistent	with	the	functional	prediction	that	<RNA_Name>	binding	to	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	would	lead	to	<Protein_Name>	translational	repression	
take	together	these	result	strongly	support	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	at	the	post-transcriptional	level	during	mouseesc	<Protein_Name>	differentiation	
it	be	show	that	<RNA_Name>	may	function	as	either	oncogene	or	tumor-suppressor	through	downregulating	various	gene	target	such	as	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	evi-1	depending	on	the	context	of	malignancy	examine	
in	our	effort	to	determine	the	potential	target	gene	of	uv-induced	<RNA_Name>	we	find	that	increase	<RNA_Name>	correlate	with	reduced	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	whose	inhibition	have	be	link	to	carcinogenesis	of	skin	cancer	upon	uv	radiation	
furthermore	the	decrease	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	response	to	uv	radiation	be	rescue	by	express	a	<RNA_Name>	sponge	inhibitor	in	hek293t	cell	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	play	a	critical	role	in	<Protein_Name>	repression	in	cell	upon	uv	treatment	
these	result	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	play	a	tumor	suppressor	role	in	pc	cell	in	addition	our	data	firstly	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	oncogenic	<Protein_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	and	the	mir-218-tpd52	axis	can	regulate	growth	of	this	prostate	cancer	cell	line

we	conclude	that	all	<Number>	mirna	family	represent	in	the	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	cluster	contribute	to	a	robust	inhibition	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	
we	show	after	<Number>	h	from	virus	infection	a	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	an	increase	of	mrna	level	of	its	gene	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>

we	also	show	that	pkc412-related	<Protein_Name>	inhibition	in	mv4-11	cell	line	cause	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	increased	level	of	mrna	and	protein	of	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
we	show	in	experiment	of	<RNA_Name>	mimic	in	k562	cell	line	a	high	increase	of	<RNA_Name>	and	an	inverse	correlation	with	the	mrna	level	of	its	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>

take	together	these	data	far	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	target	to	<Protein_Name>	and	decrease	the	activation	of	hh	pathway	in	vivo	
take	together	our	present	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	negative	regulator	of	c-abl	expression	in	smooth	muscle	cell	
the	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	degrade	c-abl	mrna	and	protein	
we	have	show	that	mirna-7	and	mirna-331-3p	directly	regulate	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	respectively	in	glioblastoma	and	prostate	cancer	cell	line	
use	quantitative	rt-pcr	we	have	show	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	regulate	degradation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	respectively

when	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	caspase-8	lose	the	ability	to	repress	necrotic	program	in	explore	the	molecular	mechanism	by	which	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	regulate	we	identify	that	<Protein_Name>	could	transcriptionally	repress	<RNA_Name>	expression	
base	on	these	data	we	hypothesize	that	increased	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	during	hl60	cell	differentiation	be	accompany	by	reduced	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	cap-dependent	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	result	support	the	conclusion	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	translation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	myeloid	cell

altogether	these	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	transcript	can	be	directly	target	by	<RNA_Name>	for	post-transcriptional	regulation	
we	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	have	growth	suppressive	activity	in	medulloblastoma	and	that	this	activity	be	partially	mediate	by	target	bmi-1	
co-transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	significantly	decrease	renilla	luciferase	activity	in	the	bmi-1	target	site	vector	but	not	in	the	mutated	site	vector

this	be	consistent	with	our	finding	that	<RNA_Name>	decrease	bmi-1	and	increase	<Protein_Name>	
rescue	experiment	with	bmi-1	lack	its	3'utr	also	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	target	bmi-1	and	thus	lead	to	increase	in	ros	level	in	cell	
furthermore	this	<RNA_Name>	mediate	reduction	of	<Protein_Name>	be	accompany	by	a	substantial	reduction	in	phosphorylated	<Protein_Name>	level	in	the	cancer	cell	suggest	an	impairment	in	<Protein_Name>	signaling	
finally	in	a	panel	of	match	normal	colon	and	primary	colon	tumor	each	of	the	tumor	demonstrate	<RNA_Name>	down-regulation	together	with	an	increase	in	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
take	together	we	propose	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	signal	partly	by	target	<Protein_Name>	and	that	the	loss	of	<RNA_Name>	may	provide	a	selective	growth	advantage	during	colon	carcinogenesis

these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	its	3'utr	
to	validate	this	target	we	evaluate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	wro	wropcdh	and	wromir-191	cell	clone	by	western	blot	
the	introduction	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	decrease	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	but	not	mrna	consistently	with	a	posttranscriptional	regulation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	by	this	mirna

these	data	strongly	support	the	hypothesis	that	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	post-transcriptionally	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	lncap	and	22rv1	cell	
the	result	that	we	collect	by	both	the	overexpression	and	the	knock	down	of	<RNA_Name>	and	or	<RNA_Name>	converge	toward	the	identification	of	<Protein_Name>	as	an	actual	target	of	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	in	lncap	22rv1	and	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	cell	line	
these	result	support	the	bioinformatic	prediction	indicate	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	as	a	targetfor	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	denote	that	the	two	match	site	thus	identify	strongly	contribute	to	the	mirna-mrna	interaction	mediate	the	post-transcriptional	inhibition	of	the	expression	
in	accordance	with	bioinformatics	and	luciferase	activity	analyse	<Protein_Name>	be	find	to	be	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
furthermore	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	and	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	reverse	the	cytotoxicity	of	azd6244	on	the	mda-mb-231	and	hcc1937	cell	
the	overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	could	counteract	the	biological	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	in	multiple	myeloma	cell	
we	conclude	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
a	dual	luciferase	reporter	gene	analysis	reveal	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	<RNA_Name>	can	improve	the	dexamethasone	sensitivity	in	multiple	myeloma	cell	by	reduce	the	c-met	expression	and	far	decrease	the	<Protein_Name>	phosphorylation	via	target	<Protein_Name>	
we	find	that	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	be	significantly	inhibit	in	uremic	rat	couple	with	increased	<Protein_Name>	at	both	protein	and	mrna	level	compare	with	normal	control	
in	nrk-52	kidney	cell	we	further	find	that	<RNA_Name>	antagomirs	increase	<Protein_Name>	but	<RNA_Name>	mimic	decrease	<Protein_Name>	and	luciferase	assay	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	far	support	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	in	kidney	
take	together	the	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
specifically	we	show	that	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	downregulated	and	target	by	<RNA_Name>	
the	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	their	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	validate	in	cell	culture	experiment	
the	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	significantly	reduce	the	concentration	of	secreted	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	protein	from	both	cell	line	whereas	the	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	increase	the	amount	of	secrete	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	measure	by	elisa	
transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	significantly	reduce	the	amount	of	<Protein_Name>	in	both	cell	line	however	a	treatment	with	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	show	no	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	expression	
the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	suppress	<Protein_Name>	whereas	the	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	promote	<Protein_Name>	expression	take	
together	our	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
we	far	identify	that	<Number>	<Protein_Name>	protein	and	<Number>	antiapoptotic	protein	be	authentic	target	for	<RNA_Name>	
as	show	by	luciferase	reporter	assay	<RNA_Name>	bound	directly	to	the	<Number>	'	-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	candidate	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	in	vsmcs	
we	obtain	evidence	in	the	present	study	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	expression	be	down-regulated	by	<RNA_Name>	
knockdown	of	<Protein_Name>	recapitulate	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	and	accompany	with	decreased	glucose	metabolism	
take	together	above	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	prostate	cancer	
take	together	these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	down-regulates	<Protein_Name>	to	suppress	tumor	growth	in	prostate	cancer	
the	result	show	that	mir-	<Number>	specifically	target	the	gene	encode	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	as	demonstrate	by	a	reduction	in	the	protein	and	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	suggest	that	exogenous	<RNA_Name>	downregulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	
we	further	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	hnrnp-k	
consistent	with	a	bona	fide	interaction	we	observe	a	great	and	very	significant	enrichment	of	<RNA_Name>	in	the	hnrnp-k	<Protein_Name>	relative	to	the	igg	control	<Protein_Name>	with	two	hnrnp-k	different	antibody	
together	the	rna	pull-down	native	<Protein_Name>	cross-linked	<Protein_Name>	and	deletion	mapping	result	demonstrate	a	specific	association	between	hnrnp-k	and	<RNA_Name>	
additionally	we	discover	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	binding	to	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
a	western	blot	perform	on	the	same	cell	show	that	<Protein_Name>	protein	be	clearly	reduce	in	the	stable	transfection	cell	line	of	<RNA_Name>	as	compare	to	cell	transfected	with	the	control	vector	
the	luciferase	reporter	assay	directly	support	the	hypothesis	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	through	at	least	one	mirna	recognition	element	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	interacts	directly	with	the	predicted	binding	site	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	gmec	
data	suggest	that	in	addition	to	possible	antitumor	effect	treatment	of	hcv-infected	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	cell	with	ifn-alpha	upregulates	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	thereby	reduce	c-met	expression	and	hcv	pathogenesis	
<RNA_Name>	expression	decrease	by	<Number>	compare	to	the	negative	control	whereas	<Protein_Name>	level	be	increase	in	addition	to	<Protein_Name>	target	gene	know	to	influence	myeloid	leukemia	
since	decrease	<RNA_Name>	expression	can	affect	<Protein_Name>	expression	we	examine	the	clonogenic	property	in	methylcellulose	colony	assay	
enhanced	colony	formation	be	observe	in	the	<RNA_Name>	knockdown	human	fetal	liver	cell	compare	to	the	scramble	mir-target	
these	experiment	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	be	a	tumor	suppressor	in	aml	principally	by	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	expression	
we	clone	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	into	a	luciferase	reporter	and	find	that	although	<RNA_Name>	down-regulated	the	luciferase	activity	<RNA_Name>	up-regulated	it	
to	determine	the	role	of	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	regulate	its	expression	we	delete	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	in	variant	<Number>	
3f	neither	<RNA_Name>	nor	<RNA_Name>	have	any	effect	on	the	luciferase	activity	highlight	the	importance	of	this	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	
therefore	these	result	suggest	that	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	present	in	the	tpm1-utr	region	be	critical	for	mir-21-mediated	regulation	at	the	translational	level	
thus	even	though	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	be	away	from	the	<Protein_Name>	it	be	still	functional	
this	result	far	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	<RNA_Name>	target	
the	no-dependent	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	family	suggest	a	role	for	these	mirs	during	<Protein_Name>	commitment	to	mesendoderm	
to	verify	this	hypothesis	<Number>	representative	<RNA_Name>	family	member	with	different	seed	sequence	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	both	of	which	be	able	to	target	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	overexpressed	at	high	and	low	copy	number	as	pre-mirs	in	undifferentiated	<Protein_Name>	
we	also	report	for	the	first	time	that	<RNA_Name>	target	calcium-regulated	heat	stable	protein	<Number>	which	regulate	the	stability	of	tumor	necrosis	factor	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
western	blot	result	reveal	that	overexpressed	<RNA_Name>	also	inhibit	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
furthermore	the	qrt-pcr	result	indicate	that	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	be	downregulated	by	overexpressed	<RNA_Name>	
all	these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	which	directly	target	its	3'utr	and	that	<Protein_Name>	serve	as	a	mediator	of	<RNA_Name>	by	regulate	the	production	of	tnf-alpha	and	thereby	affect	foam	cell	formation	
the	luciferase	activity	of	reporter	drive	by	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	3'-untranslated	region	in	sgc7901	<Protein_Name>	cell	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	both	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	identify	a	functional	targetsequence	for	<RNA_Name>	in	the	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	expression	be	inversely	proportional	to	<RNA_Name>	expression	level

after	deletion	of	one	or	both	of	the	two	putative	mir-129-binding	sit	the	luciferase	activity	rise	remarkably	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	gene	through	these	two	binding	site	
immunoblot	and	immunofluorescence	analysis	show	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	melanoma	cell	result	in	significant	downregulation	of	cyclins	d1	d3	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
moreover	the	negative	regulatory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	cyclin	d1	expression	be	indeed	mediate	through	bind	to	3'utr	of	thetarget	as	show	by	in	vitro	luciferase	assay	<RNA_Name>	
apoptosis	during	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	signal	where	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	be	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	respectively	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	influence	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	vitro	via	its	3'utr	which	suggest	that	post-transcriptional	event	regulate	or	influence	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	the	chick	oviduct	
these	result	strongly	suggest	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	il-6	overexpression	via	direct	binding	to	putative	bind	site	in	the	il-6	3'utr	region	during	cm	or	mcp-1	induction	in	thp-1	cell

the	application	of	anti-mir-218	restored	and	<RNA_Name>	mimic	suppress	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	result	from	<Protein_Name>	or	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	differentially	regulate	<Protein_Name>	through	<RNA_Name>	in	our	study	<RNA_Name>	specifically	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	the	gene	for	<Protein_Name>	and	regulate	the	tyrosine	phosphorylation	of	gsk-3b	and	<Protein_Name>	
interestingly	two	gene	that	be	significantly	downregulated	be	the	lncrna	<RNA_Name>	and	a	protein	cod	gene	<Protein_Name>	
this	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	may	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	through	the	binding	sequence	on	its	3'utr	region	
to	far	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	we	use	a	lentiviral	delivery	system	to	overexpress	<RNA_Name>	in	tumor	cell

our	data	indicate	that	an	enforced	<RNA_Name>	expression	lead	to	a	dramatic	reduction	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	at	both	the	mrna	and	protein	level	suggest	a	potential	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	
the	relative	luciferase	activity	of	the	wt	construct	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	both	the	colon	cancer	cell	be	significantly	reduce	in	the	presence	of	<RNA_Name>	whereas	such	a	suppressive	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	luciferase	activity	be	not	observe	in	both	cell	with	the	<Protein_Name>	construct	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	highlight	a	direct	and	specific	interaction	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
in	addition	<Protein_Name>	can	inhibit	<RNA_Name>	by	directly	act	on	the	transcription	factor	bind	site	in	<RNA_Name>	gene	and	<RNA_Name>	can	posttranscriptionally	silence	bcl-2	
the	level	of	bcl-2	protein	be	clearly	reduce	in	mir-148a-overexpressing	rko	and	lovo	cell	compare	with	control	cell	
hence	these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	control	by	the	transcription	factor	<Protein_Name>	and	activate	the	<Protein_Name>	c-	aspase	9-	aspase	3-	<Protein_Name>	intrinsic	apoptosis	pathway	by	silence	bcl-2	posttranscriptionally	in	colorectal	cancer	cell

these	result	suggest	that	ctd	inhibits	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	function	in	breast	cancer	as	indicate	by	a	reduction	of	its	target	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	which	be	important	tumor	suppressor	in	breast	cancer	
moreover	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	homolog	a	unique	tumor	suppressor	gene	be	confirm	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	messenger	rna	expression	be	decrease	in	nsclc	tissue	and	be	inversely	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	promote	growth	metastasis	and	chemoresistance	in	nsclc	cell	at	least	partially	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	<RNA_Name>	target	in	nsclc	in	addition	we	also	find	that	<RNA_Name>	can	enhance	proliferation	migration	invasion	and	chemoresistance	of	nsclc	via	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
we	determine	whether	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	<Protein_Name>	protein	by	transiently	induce	or	inhibit	<RNA_Name>	in	mcf10a	cell	
transient	overexpression	or	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	noticeable	change	in	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
together	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulates	<Protein_Name>	protein	by	target	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
<Protein_Name>	appear	to	directly	induce	<RNA_Name>	to	target	<Protein_Name>	
the	promoter	of	<RNA_Name>	and	mir-29b1	<Number>	also	contain	bind	site	for	teads	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	transcriptionally	regulate	<RNA_Name>	to	inhibit	<Protein_Name>

each	<RNA_Name>	be	sufficient	to	rescue	the	effect	of	<Protein_Name>	knockdown	on	phosphorylation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	s6	
these	data	support	that	the	<RNA_Name>	family	be	important	for	the	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	by	contrast	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	by	transfection	of	4t1-luc2-nm	cell	with	as-mir-101	increase	the	activity	of	a	luciferase	reporter	<Protein_Name>	to	the	wt	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
mir-122-induced	down-regulation	of	ho-1	negatively	affect	mir-122-mediated	suppression	of	hbv	
we	further	find	that	the	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	oxygenase-1	by	<RNA_Name>	play	a	negative	role	in	the	mir-122-mediated	inhibition	of	viral	expression	
<RNA_Name>	have	a	predict	binding	site	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
consistent	with	the	reporter	assay	we	observe	that	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	decrease	mrna	and	protein	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	relative	to	the	scramble	group	
these	finding	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	in	o	cell	
therefore	<Protein_Name>	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
because	<Protein_Name>	be	a	nuclear	protein	with	predominant	expression	in	the	nucleus	we	hypothesize	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	repress	<Protein_Name>	via	seed-match	target	site	
here	we	identify	a	novel	mechanism	by	which	mutant	<Protein_Name>	demonstrate	<Protein_Name>	effect	to	facilitate	emt	and	cancer	cell	invasion	by	repress	<RNA_Name>	an	inhibitor	of	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	impairs	cell	invasion	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	together	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	downregulates	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	ec	cell	by	destabilize	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	as	well	as	translational	suppression	
transduction	of	<RNA_Name>	cause	marked	inhibition	of	the	wt	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	but	have	no	effect	on	mutant	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	addition	<RNA_Name>	inhibition	by	anti-mir-130b	substantially	increased	luciferase	activity	of	wt	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	compare	with	control	anti-mirna	
curcumin	induces	hypomethylation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	promoter	and	subsequent	upregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	
this	lead	to	downregulation	of	<RNA_Name>	target	gene	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	that	culminate	in	decreased	proliferation	and	increase	apoptosis	of	bladder	cancer	cell	
<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	direct	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	could	significantly	downregulate	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	but	not	its	mrna	level	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	potential	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
lastly	result	from	our	dual-luciferase	reporter	assay	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	the	functional	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
furthermore	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	could	suppress	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	reduction	of	<RNA_Name>	level	markedly	increase	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	cardiomyocytes	by	western	blot	analysis	suggest	that	the	contribution	of	<RNA_Name>	to	cardiomyocyte	hypertrophy	may	be	partially	through	target	<Protein_Name>	
use	luciferase	assay	we	show	that	overexpression	of	mir-	<Number>	in	293t	cell	could	significantly	suppress	the	luciferase	activity	of	a	reporter	<Protein_Name>	with	<Number>	utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
to	investigate	whether	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	suppress	by	<RNA_Name>	in	cardiomyocytes	western	blot	be	use	to	analyze	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
the	result	show	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	in	cardiomyocytes	significantly	down-regulated	<Protein_Name>	expression	level	while	inhibition	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	level	markedly	increase	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
depression	of	key	k	channel	via	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	may	contribute	to	the	slowing	of	myocyte	repolarization	and	thereby	qt	prolongation	and	the	associated	arrhythmia	in	diabetic	heart	
we	identify	three	mirs	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	expression	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	aml	cell	line

the	<RNA_Name>	mimic	treatment	increase	<RNA_Name>	expression	5b	and	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	
take	together	we	conclude	that	<RNA_Name>	be	able	to	directly	bind	the	3'-utrs	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
we	have	establish	the	<Protein_Name>	transcript	as	subject	to	regulation	by	<RNA_Name>	through	<RNA_Name>	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
4b	show	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	the	luciferase	activity	of	the	wild-type	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	but	mutation	of	the	<RNA_Name>	mirna-responsive	element	within	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	abolishes	<RNA_Name>	action	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	target	one	complementary	sequence	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	<Protein_Name>

these	finding	far	confirm	a	functional	role	for	<Protein_Name>	in	promote	emt-like	transformation	of	mammary	epithelial	cell	as	well	as	establish	a	role	for	<RNA_Name>	in	inhibit	this	process	
in	support	of	our	in	vitro	finding	<RNA_Name>	down-regulation	in	tissue	sample	of	breast	cancer	correlate	with	the	high	level	of	<Protein_Name>	overexpression	observe	by	immunohistochemistry

thus	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	cell	migration	and	invasion	be	mainly	mediate	by	<Protein_Name>	
we	find	negative	relationship	between	<RNA_Name>	and	forkhead	box	<Number>	and	<RNA_Name>	and	serum	response	factor	at	all	developmental	stage	suggest	that	forkhead	box	<Number>	and	serum	response	factor	be	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	respectively	
<RNA_Name>	be	mainly	express	during	embryogenesis	and	promotes	muscle	cell	proliferation	by	directly	repress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
in	addition	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	they	jointly	participate	in	protein	degradation	
the	decrease	level	of	<RNA_Name>	with	age	suggest	an	increase	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	which	may	promote	muscle	atrophy	during	the	late	stage	of	<Protein_Name>	muscle	development	
in	addition	our	result	of	western	blot	show	that	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	increase	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	while	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	reduce	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	3d	these	data	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>

furthermore	we	identify	b-catenin	as	the	functional	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	activation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	b-catenin	pathway	be	responsible	at	least	partially	for	mir-200a-silencing-mediated	biological	function	in	wb-f344	cell	
take	together	our	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	could	activate	at	least	in	part	the	<Protein_Name>	-beta-catenin	signal	pathway	in	wb	cell	
luciferase	assay	validate	a	functional	binding	site	for	<RNA_Name>	in	the	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	to	analyze	the	function	of	<RNA_Name>	we	transfected	<Protein_Name>	cell	with	<Number>	different	luciferase	construct	of	<Protein_Name>	wild-type	3'utr	and	mirna	precursor	29a	
figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	bind	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	be	associate	with	low	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	primary	aml	cell	
as	expect	all	<Number>	tumor	cell	line	test	with	the	egr1-3'utr	reporter	show	2-	to	10-fold	decrease	in	luciferase	activity	in	comparison	to	the	control	cell	support	our	hypothesis	that	<RNA_Name>	can	potentially	regulate	<Protein_Name>	
the	modified	reporter	mimic	combination	with	perfect	base	pairing	lead	to	significant	decrease	in	reporter	activity	confirm	the	existence	of	a	direct	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	affect	both	<Protein_Name>	mrna	transcript	level	as	well	as	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	via	translational	regulation	
furthermore	<RNA_Name>	expression	could	be	inhibit	by	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	and	the	negative	post-transcriptionally	regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	on	hla-g	be	also	demonstrate	through	gain-	and	loss-of-function	study	
and	result	from	luciferase	assay	show	that	hla-g	3'utr	be	also	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	while	no	obvious	regulation	on	mut-hla-g	3'utr	be	observe	at	the	same	time	
in	this	study	we	validate	that	hla-g	expression	be	repress	by	<RNA_Name>	while	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	also	inhibit	by	tgf	--	<Protein_Name>	induction	in	gc	cell	line

these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	at	least	in	part	by	regulate	the	stability	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
3d	ectopic	transfection	of	<RNA_Name>	reduce	the	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	um1	cell	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	tscc	cell	growth	at	least	in	part	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
ectopic	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	mimic	lead	to	inhibit	cell	growth	and	apoptosis	while	block	expression	of	the	<RNA_Name>	result	in	increased	cell	proliferation	
finally	we	confirm	that	down-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	in	breast	cancer	be	inversely	associate	with	<Protein_Name>	expression	level	
these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	may	directly	affect	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	by	target	their	predict	target	site	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr

by	target	prediction	analysis	and	luciferase	reporter	assay	we	observe	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	the	protein	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	directly	act	on	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
far	bioinformatic	analysis	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	this	interaction	be	experimentally	validated	
these	finding	confirm	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	transcript	through	direct	interaction	with	its	3'utr	
our	finding	indicate	that	proneural	glioma	be	specifically	characterize	by	<RNA_Name>	downregulation	with	subsequent	derepression	of	the	mirna-	downstream	target	<Protein_Name>	a	process	that	promote	tumorigenesis	both	in	vitro	and	in	vivo	
from	this	we	conclude	that	the	<RNA_Name>	consensus	bind	sequence	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	mediate	the	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	mitogen	and	proangiogenic	factor	
we	further	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	target	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	and	reduce	the	abundance	of	<Protein_Name>	at	both	mrna	and	protein	level	
these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	might	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	play	an	important	role	in	<Protein_Name>	differentiation	
these	data	suggest	that	the	targeting	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	be	conserve	in	mescs	
the	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	during	differentiation	of	mescs	be	at	least	in	part	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	intimately	involve	in	the	cell	lineage	speci-	fication	of	mescs	and	account	for	the	mesendodermal	commitment	when	<RNA_Name>	be	deregulate	
take	together	these	data	show	that	imp-1	protein	expression	be	under	control	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	
we	also	determine	that	this	regulation	require	the	3'utr	of	imp-1	because	<RNA_Name>	and	the	lna	inhibitor	have	opposite	effect	on	the	expression	of	luciferase	when	they	be	cotransfected	into	cell	together	with	a	fusion	construct	of	luciferase	and	the	imp-1	3'utr	
mutation	of	either	of	these	two	<Protein_Name>	significantly	inhibit	luciferase	repression	by	<RNA_Name>	
c	imp-1	be	posttranscriptionally	regulate	through	the	3'utr	by	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	data	show	that	similar	to	<Protein_Name>	imp-1	protein	expression	be	under	control	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	through	target	<Protein_Name>	in	its	3'utr	
these	data	suggest	that	imp-1	be	one	of	the	major	target	of	<RNA_Name>	that	regulate	growth	of	these	cell	and	be	consistent	with	<RNA_Name>	cause	growth	reduction	through	reduction	of	imp-1	expression	which	then	indirectly	affect	expression	of	cell	cycle	regulator	
<RNA_Name>	expression	affect	the	proliferation	and	apoptosis	of	human	glioma	cell	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
moreover	after	mutate	the	two	<RNA_Name>	target	site	within	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	the	reporter	plasmid	no	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	luciferase	signal	be	observe	indicating	that	the	inhibition	of	luciferase	activity	see	in	the	<Protein_Name>	<RNA_Name>	condition	be	due	to	direct	binding	of	<RNA_Name>	to	<Protein_Name>	in	panc02	cell	
metformin	reduce	glucose	and	insulin	level	and	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	its	direct	target	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
the	proven	or	postulate	mrna	target	of	<RNA_Name>	respond	to	lps	by	one	of	<Number>	distinct	pattern	<Number>	a	sharp	decrease	follow	by	a	prolonged	period	of	down-regulation	or	<Number>	an	immediate	robust	rise	and	subsequent	return	to	baseline	with	a	sustained	period	of	down-regulation

all	of	these	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	might	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	result	from	the	luciferase	reporter	assay	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	decrease	the	luciferase	intensity	of	wild-type	rab27a-3'utr	compare	with	the	mir-nc	cell	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	and	mcl-1	may	play	an	important	role	in	the	progression	of	cervical	cancer	
one	of	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	be	find	in	the	3'utr	of	mcl-1	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	mcl-1	expression	by	bind	to	the	3'utr	of	mcl-1	
therefore	the	same	element	that	we	demonstrate	above	to	present	ire	activity	in	the	<Protein_Name>	rna	be	also	relevant	for	<Protein_Name>	transcription	
we	also	determine	whether	expression	of	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	be	determinant	for	the	conservation	of	the	intron	in	the	5-	-utr	
as	show	in	figure	6b	expression	of	this	<Protein_Name>	induce	the	maintenance	of	the	intron	in	the	5-	-utr	of	endogenous	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
these	result	suggest	the	level	of	the	<Protein_Name>	control	<Protein_Name>	5-	-utr	splice	in	these	cell	line	
to	confirm	the	fact	that	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	a	luciferase	assay	for	the	reporter	gene	express	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	be	use	
among	the	targetproteins	<Protein_Name>	show	a	significant	reverse	correlation	with	<RNA_Name>	expression	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	could	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell

the	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	through	interaction	with	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
collectively	the	data	suggest	that	the	zebrafish	embryo	model	can	be	use	to	monitor	the	migration	of	breast	cancer	cell	in	a	living	animal	and	<RNA_Name>	overexpression	or	<Protein_Name>	silencing	could	cause	a	significant	reduction	in	breast	cancer	cell	migration	in	vivo	
in	neuroblastoma	cell	<RNA_Name>	target	the	<Number>	'	untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	and	inhibit	its	mrna	and	protein	expression	in	addition	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	be	decrease	upon	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	and	increased	upon	addition	of	antisense	against	<RNA_Name>	
lastly	in	10-day	old	tumor	generate	by	injection	of	sk-n-as	cell	in	nude	mouse	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	be	reduce	3-fold	in	tumor	inject	intra-tumorally	with	<RNA_Name>	but	not	with	the	control	mirna

our	analysis	show	that	<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	both	at	the	mrna	and	protein	level	and	luciferase	assay	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	bind	to	the	3'untranslated	region	of	<Protein_Name>	
our	finding	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	significantly	up-regulated	in	nsclc	tissue	and	regulate	nsclc	cell	proliferation	migration	and	invasion	partially	via	the	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	
microrna-196a	promotes	non-small	cell	lung	cancer	cell	proliferation	and	invasion	through	target	<Protein_Name>

our	functional	study	on	<Protein_Name>	far	support	its	role	as	a	target	for	<RNA_Name>	as	knockdown	of	<Protein_Name>	almost	perfectly	mimic	the	phenotype	on	cell	proliferation	cell	migration	and	cell	invasion	induce	by	the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>

thus	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	through	the	3'utr	while	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
we	also	measure	the	mrna	and	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	after	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	overexpression

through	restore	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	mir-126-transfected	hepg2	cell	we	find	that	overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	could	partially	abrogate	the	mir-126-mediated	suppression	of	cell	growth	
thus	our	data	identify	<RNA_Name>	as	a	tumor	suppressor	in	hcc	through	at	least	partially	by	target	<Protein_Name>

because	only	construct	a	and	b	be	as	functional	as	the	wt	reporter	these	data	collectively	indicate	that	only	the	site	specific	for	<RNA_Name>	be	critical	for	the	regulation	of	il-6	3'utr	by	the	endogenous	mirs	
these	data	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	and	regulate	il-6	3'utr	in	dc	
the	pcdna3	<Number>	-mir-223	vector	efficiently	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	while	silence	<RNA_Name>	increase	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	and	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	in	ht29	and	lovo	cell	
these	data	highlight	that	<RNA_Name>	interacts	with	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	repress	its	expression	especially	through	the	first	binding	site	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	play	an	important	role	in	regulate	doxorubicin	chemosensitivity	directly	through	adjustment	of	anti-apoptosis	activity	by	target	<Protein_Name>	in	colon	cancer	cell	
our	study	demonstrate	that	suppression	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	elevation	of	its	direct	targetgene	<Protein_Name>	expression	therefore	make	the	human	colon	cancer	cell	more	resistant	to	doxorubicin	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	which	specifically	interact	with	the	first	potential	binding	site	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	3'utr	
<RNA_Name>	have	a	modulator	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	pro-apoptosis	activity	which	play	important	role	in	regulate	doxorubicin	chemosensitivity	in	colon	cancer	cell	
these	result	indicate	that	ethanol-induced	reduction	in	the	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	may	increase	the	mrna	level	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	the	amygdala	and	regulate	anxiolytic-like	effect	
these	assay	point	to	<Protein_Name>	as	a	functionally	important	<RNA_Name>	target	in	the	<Protein_Name>	
this	indicate	that	endogenous	level	of	<RNA_Name>	be	sufficient	to	negatively	regulate	gene	expression	via	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	the	<Protein_Name>	in	vivo	
because	s2	cell	endogenously	express	<RNA_Name>	we	ask	whether	deplete	<RNA_Name>	would	lead	to	elevated	expression	of	the	luciferase	reporter	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	can	act	directly	via	the	predicted	target	site	to	regulate	<Protein_Name>	level	
finally	we	utilize	both	luciferase	reporter	assay	and	western	blot	analysis	to	identify	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
mir-302-mediated	antiproliferation	function	through	cosuppression	of	<Protein_Name>	cyclin	d1	d2	and	bmi-1	
we	find	that	<RNA_Name>	over	a	certain	threshold	concentration	be	able	to	inactivate	both	complex	through	simultaneous	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	and	cyclin	d1	d2	activity	
different	cellular	condition	may	affect	the	way	of	mirna-mrna	interaction	to	change	the	preference	of	mirna-mediated	gene	target	
however	there	be	currently	no	report	relate	to	either	the	dose-dependent	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	or	the	stringency	of	mir-302-targetinteraction	our	study	provide	important	insight	on	these	issue	and	for	the	first	time	reveal	that	<RNA_Name>	function	differently	between	human	and	mouse	
our	data	show	that	retinoic	acid	induction	in	nb4	cell	lead	to	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	and	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	
we	also	test	the	ability	of	<RNA_Name>	in	down-regulating	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	result	in	a	<Number>	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
altogether	these	result	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	potential	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
the	finding	from	<RNA_Name>	null	animal	together	with	our	find	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	and	inhibits	myeloid	cell-cycle	progression	suggest	that	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	could	be	a	critical	step	in	granulocytic	differentiation	
in	addition	<Protein_Name>	depress	the	elevated	expression	of	connective	tissue	growth	factor	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	through	the	<Protein_Name>	pathway	
exogenous	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	icam-1	expression	on	huvecs	follow	<Protein_Name>	stimulation	
since	the	putative	<RNA_Name>	site	have	be	validate	for	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	s1	cell	we	repeat	the	3'race	assay	use	s1	cell	transfected	with	the	specific	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	
we	use	the	specific	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	to	increase	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	s1	cell	and	subsequently	confirm	the	long	sequence	in	s1	cell	and	its	absence	in	s1mi80	cell	with	a	nested	pcr	<Number>	and	nest	pcr	<Number>	
interestingly	the	perfect	pairing	of	<RNA_Name>	with	the	<RNA_Name>	complementary	sequence	lead	to	the	most	substantial	degradation	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
we	demonstrate	a	direct	role	for	<RNA_Name>	b	in	the	dramatic	postnatal	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	etr-3-like	factor	proteins	that	regulate	nearly	half	of	developmentally	regulate	splice	transition	in	the	heart	
there	be	three	conserve	<RNA_Name>	b	seed	match	in	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	two	in	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	postnatal	up-regulation	of	<RNA_Name>	b	suppress	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	in	adult	heart	via	direct	bind	to	their	respective	3'-utrs	resulting	in	a	physiological	shift	in	the	alternative	splicing	of	a	subset	of	splice	event	
these	result	demonstrate	a	direct	functional	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	and	each	of	these	region	within	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
serum	and	glucocorticoid	regulate	protein	kinase	<Number>	be	predict	as	the	target	gene	for	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	negatively	correlate	to	<Protein_Name>	expression	
consequently	<RNA_Name>	be	overexpressed	in	cell	to	verify	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	could	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	endogenous	which	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	target	for	<RNA_Name>	in	conclusion	the	data	present	in	this	study	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	down-regulation	play	pivotal	role	in	inhibit	neuropathic	pain	through	target	<Protein_Name>	gene	
besides	the	expression	level	of	<RNA_Name>	and	its	potential	target	sox-2	be	also	detect	<Number>	day	after	osteogenic	induction	the	result	show	that	sox-2	decrease	as	the	increase	of	<RNA_Name>	abundance	indicating	that	there	be	a	negative	correlation	between	<RNA_Name>	and	sox-2	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	in	bc	cell	
<Protein_Name>	3'utr	show	a	reduction	to	<Number>	<Number>	of	total	luciferase	reporter	activity	in	presence	of	<RNA_Name>	but	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	do	not	display	significant	reduction	of	luciferase	level	compare	with	the	mir-control	
these	result	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	in	bc	cell	in	addition	<Protein_Name>	be	newly	identify	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	bc	
to	confirm	these	finding	<Protein_Name>	and	mirna-30a	be	coexpressed	in	hepg2	cell	and	the	result	show	significant	inhibition	of	autophagosome	formation	and	beclin-1	and	c-myc	expression	
these	data	verify	that	<Protein_Name>	induces	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	consequently	suppress	its	direct	target	<Protein_Name>	
thus	these	result	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	
these	data	suggest	that	downexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	increase	the	chemosensitivity	to	docetaxel	to	induce	apoptosis	via	<Protein_Name>	target	in	breast	cancer	cell	
take	together	these	result	also	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	and	functional	mediator	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	far	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	follow-up	functional	analysis	our	result	show	that	the	<RNA_Name>	suppress	apoptosis	through	target	the	pro-apoptotic	protein	<Protein_Name>	
these	data	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	the	snp	rs71428439	be	able	to	influence	the	effect	of	pre-mir-149	on	the	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	directly	target	and	inhibits	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	
mir-	24-3p	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	suppress	its	expression	
conversely	the	inhibition	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	in	hct116	cell	with	anti-mir	lna200	lead	to	an	increase	in	fap-1	and	a	decrease	in	e-cadherin	expression	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	target	fap-1	
interestingly	fap-1	mrna	level	do	not	change	with	the	introduction	of	<RNA_Name>	or	with	the	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	as	determine	by	semi-quantitative	rt-pcr	
therefore	fap-1	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	regulation	of	fap-1	be	due	to	translational	repression	and	not	mrna	degradation	
this	indicate	that	the	<RNA_Name>	effect	on	<Protein_Name>	direct	apoptosis	be	mediate	by	repression	of	fap-1	
to	determine	whether	these	site	can	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	we	clone	luciferase	reporter	construct	encompass	either	<Number>	<Number>	bps	of	the	mouse	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	or	<Number>	bps	of	mouse	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	that	contain	the	<RNA_Name>	binding	site	
<Protein_Name>	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	expression	of	reporter	construct	contain	3'utr	sequence	from	mouse	<Protein_Name>	and	mouse	<Protein_Name>	in	contrast	to	rat	neuron	<Protein_Name>	cell	lack	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	expression	and	as	mention	the	human	<Protein_Name>	sequence	have	two	additional	<RNA_Name>	bind	site	this	most	likely	add	to	the	more	pronounced	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	observe	in	the	human	cell	line	
pre-mir-126	strongly	reduce	the	expression	of	p85-beta	bear	its	3'utr	compare	to	pre-mir-scramble	but	do	not	modify	the	expression	of	p85-beta	lack	its	own	3'utr	
these	result	be	also	confirm	in	ec	transfected	with	the	lna-anti-mir-126	which	show	a	high	amount	of	p85-beta	protein	compare	to	ec	transfected	with	control	lna	
we	recently	demonstrate	that	the	3'-untranslated	region	of	erbb-2	mrna	contains	two	specific	targetsites	for	binding	of	the	microrna	<RNA_Name>	and	that	<RNA_Name>	represses	erbb-2	expression	and	signal	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	
our	previous	work	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	erbb-2	expression	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	via	its	interaction	with	two	specific	targetsites	in	the	erbb-2	3'utr	one	of	which	be	immediately	distal	to	the	erbb-2-ure	
we	investigate	whether	<Protein_Name>	could	antagonize	the	ability	of	<RNA_Name>	to	down-regulate	erbb-2	expression	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	
thus	<Protein_Name>	bind	to	the	wild-type	erbb-2	<Protein_Name>	do	not	prevent	<RNA_Name>	binding	to	its	adjacent	seed	although	the	spacing	between	the	two	site	may	be	critical	for	the	regulatory	outcome	
this	result	indicate	that	loss	of	<Protein_Name>	binding	to	the	erbb-2	3'utr	<Protein_Name>	increase	the	repressive	action	of	<RNA_Name>	upon	erbb-2	mrna	
interestingly	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	find	to	contain	one	predict	binding	site	for	<RNA_Name>	conserve	between	several	specie	which	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	might	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
moreover	<Protein_Name>	be	report	very	recently	to	be	target	by	<RNA_Name>	in	hepatocellular	carcinoma	cell	line	
in	huvecs	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	decrease	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	expression	
by	contrast	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	increase	<Protein_Name>	mrna	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	expression	level	of	active	<Protein_Name>	in	endothelial	cell	
altogether	these	data	confirm	the	mir-21-dependent	regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	and	its	implication	in	the	migrating	property	of	huvecs	
these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	bound	directly	to	specific	site	in	the	3'utr	of	ikk-beta	mrna	
next	it	be	determine	whether	endogenous	expression	of	ikk-beta	could	be	downregulated	by	<RNA_Name>	
to	address	this	issue	western	blot	analysis	be	use	to	evaluate	the	expression	of	ikk-beta	at	the	protein	level	after	transfection	with	<RNA_Name>	mimic	and	nc	inpc3-ar	cell	
the	result	show	that	the	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	significantly	decrease	the	expression	level	of	ikk-beta	protein	
collectively	these	luciferase	and	western	blot	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	act	as	negative	regulator	of	expression	of	ikk-beta	
in	addition	we	show	that	the	<Protein_Name>	lysine-specific	demethylase	<Number>	a	transcriptional	co-repressor	of	nuclear	receptor	<Protein_Name>	be	a	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	represses	<Protein_Name>	expression	through	the	predict	targetsite	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	be	reduce	dramatically	in	mir-137-rfp-electropoarted	cell	compare	to	control	rna	and	rfp-electroporated	cell	provide	in	vivo	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	expression	
these	result	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	neural	stem	cell	proliferation	and	differentiation	in	embryonic	brain	through	target	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	base-pairing	to	its	3'utr	
in	this	study	we	have	confirm	that	as	the	myocardial	hypertrophy	gene	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	who	would	promote	the	occurrence	of	myocardial	hypertrophy	
next	we	implement	fluorescent	report	carrier	assay	for	deep	analysis	and	finally	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	be	directly	bind	to	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
overall	we	can	conclude	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
by	use	bioinformatics	method	and	the	fluorescent	report	carrier	assay	we	finally	identify	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
among	them	<RNA_Name>	relate	to	the	insulin	resistance	by	modulate	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	cascade	and	have	the	great	copy	number	in	the	whole	blood	<RNA_Name>

these	result	provide	evidence	that	<RNA_Name>	can	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	result	in	suppression	of	its	translation	
these	observation	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	act	as	a	tumor	promoter	by	target	the	caspase-3	gene	and	prevent	apoptosis	of	gastric	cancer	cell	through	inhibition	of	caspase-3	expression	
here	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	down-modulated	in	breast	tumor	compare	with	normal	breast	tissue	directly	target	<Protein_Name>	receptor	and	inhibit	the	activation	of	the	downstream	mediator	<Protein_Name>	the	reintroduction	of	<RNA_Name>	in	skbr3	cell	inhibit	their	clonogenic	potential	and	increase	the	responsiveness	to	tyrosine-kinase	inhibitor	gefitinib	and	lapatinib	abrogate	the	her3-mediated	resistance	and	restore	a	potent	<Protein_Name>	activity	
the	<RNA_Name>	transcript	therefore	either	may	be	less	stable	or	only	weakly	express	but	even	so	still	able	to	regulate	the	silencing	of	the	sense	<Protein_Name>	transcript	from	the	paternal	allele	northern

furthermore	we	find	that	<Protein_Name>	be	upregulated	in	docetaxel-responding	<Protein_Name>	tissue	and	its	expression	be	inversely	correlate	with	<RNA_Name>	
thus	<RNA_Name>	be	a	novel	prognostic	marker	in	<Protein_Name>	and	its	expression	be	a	potential	indicator	of	chemosensitivity	to	docetaxel-based	chemotherapy	regimen	
these	data	demonstrate	that	the	<RNA_Name>	target	the	<Protein_Name>	via	bind	with	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr

these	finding	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	target	of	<RNA_Name>	and	may	mediate	the	<Protein_Name>	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	in	iec-6	cell	
<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	prosurvival	protein	<Protein_Name>	in	enterocytes	
our	result	suggest	that	one	role	of	<RNA_Name>	in	intestinal	adaptation	be	to	activate	the	apoptotic	pathway	in	part	by	suppress	expression	of	the	antiapoptotic	<Protein_Name>	
inhibition	of	c-flip	expression	by	<RNA_Name>	contributes	to	taxol-induced	apoptosis	in	hepatocellular	carcinoma	cell

our	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	directly	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	and	moreover	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	may	be	a	potential	anti-cancer	therapeutic	for	hnscc	
these	result	provide	evidence	to	demonstrate	an	inverse	association	between	<RNA_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	in	hnscc	
our	work	confirm	that	<RNA_Name>	regulates	<Protein_Name>	through	direct	binding	in	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	moreover	optimal	suppression	of	<Protein_Name>	require	occupation	of	all	three	<RNA_Name>	site	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	down-regulation	of	<Protein_Name>	by	<RNA_Name>	be	an	effective	approach	to	suppress	the	tumorigenicity	of	hnscc	in	vitro	and	in	vivo

however	co-transfection	of	murine	cell	with	<Number>	nm	<RNA_Name>	mimic	reveal	no	change	in	luciferase	activity	of	the	vector	therefore	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	bind	to	either	the	3'utr	or	<Protein_Name>	of	gr	<Protein_Name>	
the	data	also	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	gr	<Protein_Name>	in	normal	and	injured	podocytes	induce	by	puromycin	aminonucleoside	
this	study	demonstrate	for	the	first	time	that	the	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	in	breast	cancer	cell	could	be	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>	
here	we	provide	evidence	in	human	neural	cell	of	an	aluminum-sulfate-	and	reactive	oxygen	specie	-mediated	up-regulation	of	an	nf-kappab-sensitive	<RNA_Name>	that	down-regulates	the	expression	of	complement	factor	h	an	important	repressor	of	inflammation

these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	and	-339	down-regulate	icam-1	expression	at	posttranscriptional	level	by	bind	to	the	icam-1	3'utr	
only	<RNA_Name>	repressed	expression	of	a	reporter	gene	<Protein_Name>	to	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	do	not	repress	expression	of	a	mutant	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	gene	lack	the	<RNA_Name>	seed-binding	site	
furthermore	knock-down	of	endogenous	<RNA_Name>	use	a	2-	-o-methyl	<RNA_Name>	antagomir	increase	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	activity	in	s2	cell	whereas	control	antagomirs	do	not

although	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	contain	one	putative	<RNA_Name>	site	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	reporter	do	not	respond	to	mir-279overexpression	
thus	<RNA_Name>	target	the	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	signal	pathway	by	repress	<Protein_Name>	
take	together	these	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	repress	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	and	activity	in	vivo	
take	together	these	result	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	in	vivo	
flow-dependent	expression	of	<RNA_Name>	governs	valvulogenesis	by	regulate	the	expression	of	the	same	target	as	mouse	human	<RNA_Name>	and	induces	cell	proliferation	in	the	valve-forming	endocardium	at	constriction	in	the	heart	tube	where	shear	stress	be	high	
<RNA_Name>	be	highly	express	in	malignant	tissue	and	have	several	target	gene	include	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
identification	of	<Protein_Name>	as	a	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
accord	to	bioinformatic	analysis	<Protein_Name>	be	a	putative	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
<RNA_Name>	can	bind	directly	to	their	seed	sequence	in	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
when	compare	with	that	in	the	control	group	indicate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	be	significantly	upregulated	in	o	cell	line	and	be	negatively	regulate	by	<RNA_Name>

therefore	<RNA_Name>	by	target	caspase-3	may	play	a	functional	role	in	modulate	drug-induced	cell	death	in	human	cancer	cell	
<RNA_Name>	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	its	3'utr	
these	result	indicate	that	<RNA_Name>	expression	be	inversely	correlate	with	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	activation	in	breast	cancer	cell	line	and	that	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
transwell	assay	indicate	that	restoration	of	<Protein_Name>	expression	significantly	abrogate	<RNA_Name>	reduce	cell	migration	and	invasiveness	indicative	that	<Protein_Name>	be	both	a	direct	and	functional	target	for	<RNA_Name>	
result	indicate	that	in	cell	co-overexpressing	<Protein_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	be	reduce	by	half	compare	with	cell	overexpressing	<Protein_Name>	alone	and	the	change	on	protein	level	be	also	detect	
<Protein_Name>	expression	be	repress	by	<RNA_Name>	binding	to	its	3'utr	seed	sequence	establish	<Protein_Name>	as	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
we	observe	a	marked	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	level	in	<RNA_Name>	nanovector-treated	xenograft	as	compare	with	vehicle	control	indicate	a	tangible	pharmacodynamic	readout	of	mirna	delivery	
furthermore	multiple	line	of	evidence	point	to	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	repression	in	the	expansion	of	tumor-initiating	cell	and	that	restitution	of	<RNA_Name>	expression	deplete	this	subpopulation	in	cancer	in	turn	mature	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	repress	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	respectively	effectively	complete	the	loop	
therefore	restitution	of	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	expression	in	miapaca-2	xenograft	should	attenuate	expression	of	both	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	
in	addition	resultant	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	could	be	observe	through	immunohistochemical	staining	of	tumor	section	from	both	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	nanovector-treated	and	vehicle	control	xenograft	
this	serve	as	important	in	vivo	confirmation	of	the	aforementioned	feed-forward	pathway	and	indicate	that	treatment	with	the	systemic	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	nanovector	result	in	restitution	of	mature	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	with	downregulation	of	<Protein_Name>	<Protein_Name>	target	accompany	the	observed	tumor	growth	inhibition	
cox-2	mrna	be	more	stable	in	dhuvec	and	this	be	associate	with	<RNA_Name>	downregulation	and	c-myc	induction	
recently	<RNA_Name>	have	be	identify	to	regulate	cox-2	expression	through	target	the	3'utr	that	lead	to	a	concurrent	reduction	of	cox-2	mrna	and	protein	level	and	pge	<Number>	biosynthesis	in	il-1	-stimulated	cell	
to	test	that	<Protein_Name>	may	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	the	reporter	plasmid	harbor	the	wild-type	or	mutant	3'utr	region	of	<Protein_Name>	be	construct	
overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	mimic	lead	to	a	reduction	of	luciferase	activity	when	the	reporter	construct	contain	the	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	
our	result	show	that	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	be	substantially	down-regulated	by	<RNA_Name>	6b	in	contrast	inhibition	of	<RNA_Name>	lead	to	an	increase	protein	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	hcc	cell	6d	
in	view	of	these	finding	we	propose	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
<Protein_Name>	down-regulated	in	os	tissue	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	to	determine	whether	tumor	promotive	role	of	<RNA_Name>	be	mediate	by	<Protein_Name>	we	firstly	investigate	the	role	of	<Protein_Name>	in	o	
<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	directly	downstream	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
these	data	show	that	<Protein_Name>	be	one	of	the	functional	downstream	target	of	<RNA_Name>	for	inhibit	glioma	cell	migration	and	invasion	
we	therefore	measure	the	mrna	and	protein	expression	level	of	<Protein_Name>	in	response	to	the	change	in	the	<RNA_Name>	expression	level	in	u373	cell	by	pre-146b	or	lna-anti-146b	transfection	
furthermore	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	decrease	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	when	<RNA_Name>	be	ectopically	express	
on	the	other	hand	silence	of	<RNA_Name>	increase	<Protein_Name>	expression	in	pc3r	cell	
these	finding	suggest	that	<Protein_Name>	be	indeed	a	functional	targetfor	mir-21-induced	chemoresistance	to	docetaxel	in	<Protein_Name>	cell	
to	verify	whether	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	may	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	the	dual-luciferase	assay	be	employ	
these	result	illustrate	<RNA_Name>	and	<RNA_Name>	could	inhibit	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	by	bind	to	its	mrna	3'utr	
in	addition	we	experimentally	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	the	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	b-3p	hypo-expression	of	<Protein_Name>	suppress	proliferation	migration	and	invasion	of	mda-mb-231	cell	and	overexpression	of	<Protein_Name>	significantly	rescue	the	inhibitory	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	b-3p	on	mda-mb-231	cell	growth	migration	and	invasion	
these	finding	indicate	a	direct	interaction	between	<RNA_Name>	b-3p	and	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	mda-mb-231	cell	
ectopic	<RNA_Name>	significantly	suppress	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	expression	in	pancreatic	cancer	cell	
these	result	strongly	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	negatively	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	post-transcriptionally	our	study	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	potentially	function	as	an	oncogene	base	on	our	experimental	evidence	we	also	demonstrate	that	mir-301a-induced	proliferation	and	invasion	depend	on	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	in	the	manner	of	directly	posttranscriptional	downregulation	in	gastric	cancer	
therefore	we	consider	that	<Protein_Name>	should	be	at	least	one	of	targetgenes	of	<RNA_Name>	
thus	the	identification	of	the	role	of	<RNA_Name>	as	an	oncogene	through	target	<Protein_Name>	in	gastric	cancer	help	us	to	further	elucidate	the	potential	molecular	mechanism	of	gastric	cancer	development	and	could	potentially	have	diagnostic	as	well	as	therapeutic	value	in	the	future	
<RNA_Name>	play	an	important	role	in	inhibit	the	proliferation	of	nsclc	by	target	<Protein_Name>	
these	result	confirm	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	gene	of	<RNA_Name>	
take	together	these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	suppresses	<Protein_Name>	expression	by	directly	target	the	3'utr	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene

these	data	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	could	act	as	a	tumor	suppressor	by	target	<Protein_Name>	in	npc	to	directly	assess	the	effect	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	expression	we	transfected	<RNA_Name>	into	5-8f	or	hone1	cell	and	find	that	overexpression	of	<RNA_Name>	reduce	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	
furthermore	anti-mir-216b	transfection	increase	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	in	cne2	and	np69	cell	
these	western	blotting	result	demonstrate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	negative	regulator	of	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	pathway	
these	observation	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	inhibits	the	<Protein_Name>	and	<Protein_Name>	pathway	by	target	<Protein_Name>	in	addition	we	confirm	that	change	in	<RNA_Name>	expression	alter	<Protein_Name>	protein	expression	level	in	lysates	from	mouse	tumor	
the	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	suppress	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	which	control	cell	proliferation	and	invasion	by	regulate	<Protein_Name>	expression	
the	result	show	that	<RNA_Name>	or	<RNA_Name>	directly	regulate	<Protein_Name>	
the	luciferase	reporter	gene	assay	confirm	that	the	<Protein_Name>	mrna	3'utr	region	contain	a	binding	site	for	<RNA_Name>	<RNA_Name>	
we	determine	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	targetgene	of	<RNA_Name>	by	use	a	sensor	luciferase	reporter	assay	
as	judge	by	use	a	qrt-pcr	the	level	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	in	the	cell	transfected	with	<RNA_Name>	remain	unchanged	compare	with	bmp-2-stimulated	cell	
thus	the	increase	in	<Protein_Name>	expression	may	be	due	to	the	drop	in	the	level	of	<RNA_Name>	after	the	bmp-2	treatment	
these	finding	suggest	that	<RNA_Name>	regulate	the	expression	of	<Protein_Name>	at	a	translational	level

luciferase	reporter	assay	prof	<Protein_Name>	be	a	direct	target	of	<RNA_Name>	
thus	<RNA_Name>	target	<Protein_Name>	through	a	direct	interaction	with	its	bind	site	in	the	3'utr	
take	together	these	result	demonstrate	that	<Protein_Name>	be	a	functional	target	of	<RNA_Name>	contributing	to	its	role	in	mir-137-mediated	repression	of	cell	proliferation	and	induction	of	apoptosis	in	melanoma	cell	
in	this	work	we	focus	on	the	post-transcriptional	regulation	of	the	<Protein_Name>	gene	a	major	tumor	suppressor	and	regulator	of	double-stranded	break	dna	repair	and	show	that	its	mrna	be	target	by	many	member	of	the	<RNA_Name>	<Number>	group	at	a	site	locate	within	the	<Protein_Name>

because	<Protein_Name>	have	be	report	as	a	downstream	target	of	<Protein_Name>	therefore	we	check	the	protein	expression	of	the	phosphorylated	<Protein_Name>	expression	and	find	that	the	expression	of	the	phosphorylated	<Protein_Name>	be	concomitantly	decrease	by	<RNA_Name>	inhibitor	
use	a	luciferase	reporter	assay	we	far	confirm	the	translational	repression	activity	of	<RNA_Name>	on	<Protein_Name>	by	identify	the	targetrecognition	element	within	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	
figure	<Number>	<RNA_Name>	directly	interact	with	<Protein_Name>	3'utr	in	the	present	study	we	show	that	<RNA_Name>	target	sequence	within	the	3'utr	of	<Protein_Name>	and	be	capable	of	arrest	the	translation	of	luciferase	from	a	luciferase	p27-3'utr	gene	fusion	in	transfected	u251	glioblastoma	cell	
this	in	vitro	evidence	in	conjunction	with	our	find	that	<Protein_Name>	protein	level	decrease	in	concert	with	increased	<RNA_Name>	expression	in	human	glioma	support	the	conclusion	that	progressive	increase	in	<RNA_Name>	expression	lead	to	the	increase	translational	repression	of	<Protein_Name>	thus	increase	the	malignancy	of	glioma	
thus	we	speculate	that	<RNA_Name>	be	an	oncogene	and	knockdown	of	<RNA_Name>	decrease	<Protein_Name>	expression	
to	test	it	we	investigate	the	change	of	<Protein_Name>	mrna	and	protein	level	after	a549	and	h1650	cell	be	transfected	with	sirna	target	lncrna	<RNA_Name>	negative	control	blank
