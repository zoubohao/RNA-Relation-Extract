26870816_1	newly generated mir-23a destabilizes keap1 mrna by binding to its 3'utr.
26870816_2	mir-23a overexpression led to a statistically significant decrease in luciferase expression, showing that keap1 mrna was a direct mir-23a target .
26870816_3	this regulation was physiologically relevant, because cells that overexpressed mir-23a increased expression of endogenous nqo-1 mrna .
21885851_1	as shown in figure 2a to 2c, both mir-16 and mir-424 significantly decreased vegfr2, fgfr1, and vegf protein and mrna levels.
21885851_2	importantly, inhibition of endogenous mir-16 or mir-424 increased the expression of vegfr2, fgfr1, and vegf at both the protein and mrna levels .
21885851_3	the targeting activity of these mirnas on vegfr2 and fgfr1 was also relevant for human aortic ecs , a human adult ec type from a different vascular bed than huvecs.
21885851_5	as shown in figure 3c, stimulation of huvecs with vegf reduced both vegfr2 and fgfr1 3'utr activity, whereas no effect was observed when cells were transfected with the empty vector control, indicating that some endogenous mirnas involved in the regulation of vegfr2 and fgfr1 were induced to regulate their expression under stimulated conditions.
21885851_6	interestingly, endogenous inhibition of mir-16 or mir-424 before vegf stimulation restored vegfr2 and fgfr1 3'utr activity , indicating that these effects are likely to be mediated by mir-16 and mir-424 upregulation in ecs.
21885851_7	altogether, these data indicate that mir-16/-424 regulates cell-intrinsic angiogenic responses in vitro and are consistent with their targeting activity on vegfr2, fgfr1, and vegf in ecs.

20466882_2	taken together,these findings demonstrate that abca1 protein expression is regulated by mir-33a b.
20466882_3	together, these results suggest that mir-33a b inhibit expression of human abca1 by targeting the abca1 3'utr for translation repression or mrna degradation.
20466882_4	these findings demonstrate that mir-33 posttranscriptional repression of abca1 results in retention of intracellular cholesterol in macrophages and are in keeping with our hypothesis that mir-33 regulates cholesterol trafficking by controlling abca1 levels.

21816922_7	these data indicate that mir-17 20 inhibition suppresses proliferation in retinoblastoma cell lines, while mir-19 inhibition has little consequence.
21816922_8	moreover, our observations of p21cip1 up-regulation upon mir-17-92 inhibition in human retinoblastoma cells and p21cip1 suppression upon mir-17-92 overexpression in murine retinas suggested that p21cip1 may be a critical mir-17-92 target in retinoblastoma.

20558762_2	since mir-802 and the hat1r protein are expressed in similar colon cell types, this suggests that mir-802 may play a physiological role in regulating the expression of the hat1r in the gi system.
20558762_3	these results indicate that mir-802 can interfere with luciferase mrna translation by direct interaction with the hat1r 3'utr at the predicted targetsite.
20558762_4	taken together, gain-of-function experiments suggest that mir-802 can decrease hat1r expression by inhibiting translation of the mrna, rather than targeting for degradation
22094713_1	furthermore, we verified that mir-29b directly targeted and inhibited bcl2l2 gene expression, and then increased neuronal cell death.
22094713_2	importantly, bcl2l2 overexpression rescued neuronal cell death induced by mir-29b.

26512777_1	we observed no repression in luciferase activity after mutating or deleting the binding site ,1e, suggesting that mir-22 directly interacts with the tip60 3'utr and targets tip60.
26512777_2	these data indicate that mir-22 down-regulates endogenous tip60 expression.
26512777_3	these findings suggest that repression of tip60 by mir-22 increases cell migration and this can be reverted by ablating activity of mir-22 or through the overexpression of a tip60 that lacks mir-22 binding site.
26512777_4	thus, mir-22 stimulates cell migration by targeting tip60.
26512777_5	these results suggest that mir-22 targets tip60 leading to an increase in cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells thereby promoting metastasis.
22891274_1	collectively, these results demonstrate traf6 and irak1 to be bona fide targets of mir-146a in primary mouse cd4 + and cd8 + t cells.

23472141_1	mir-133a and -204 211 are known to target the master osteogenic transcription factor runx2. further assays suggest that sost, which encodes the wnt signaling antagonist sclerostin, and alkaline phosphatase are two additional targets of mir-204 211.
23472141_2	mir-141 200a has been known to target the transcription factor dlx5. since mir-141 200a has been known as dlx5-targeting mirnas , these findings also imply that osx may negatively regulate dlx5 protein synthesis via, at least in part, up-regulation of mir-141 200a.
23472141_3	however, the role of mir-192 and mir-1194 in osteogenesis is yet to be known.
23472141_4	since mir-133a and -204 211 are known as runx2-targeting mirnas , , these observations also imply that osx may modulate the cellular level of runx2 protein via in part down-regulation of mir-133a and -204 211.

17179747_6	in summary, these studies followed the accumulation during development of mir-122 from its mrna precursor, hcr, through to identification of what may be a specific mrna target cat-1.
21328460_1	a conserved targetsite for mir-21 within the cdk2ap1-3'utr at nt 349-370 was predicted by bioinformatics software and an inverse correlation of mir-21 and cdk2ap1 protein was observed.

21328460_3	these primary data suggest that mir-21 might downregulate cdk2ap1 expression at the post-transcriptional level.
21328460_5	these data suggest that mir-21 specifically downregulates cdk2ap1 at the post-transcriptional level, and that mir-21 positively regulates proliferation of hacat cells in vitro.
22929050_1	we found that mir375 inhibited autophagosome formation, as indicated by the decreased number of green fluorescent protein -lc3 puncta. in addition, both lc3-i and lc3-ii detection and bafilomycin a1 assays supported that mir375 blocked the conversion of lc3-i to lc3-ii, which is required for the elongation of the phagopore and in turn, the formation of the autophagosome.

20665731_1	in this study, we focused on mir-29b and mir-125a, which were predicted to regulate pdpn, and demonstrated that these micrornas directly targetthe 3' untranslated region of pdpn and inhibit invasion, apoptosis, and proliferation of glioblastomas.
20665731_2	mutation of mir-29b and mir-125a interaction sites rescued the luciferase activity, thus confirming the direct interaction with pdpn 3'utr by these micrornas.
20665731_3	these results suggest that mir-29b and mir-125a directly regulate podoplanin expression in glioblastoma cells.

23166713_1	taken together, these findings demonstrate that mir-361-5p affects the levels of secreted vegfa, further suggesting that the mirna is able to repress endogenous vegfa expression in vitro. in summary, we found that out of a panel of six mirnas targeting vegfa, only mir-361-5p levels were decreased in scc expressing high levels of vegfa, indicating that mir-361-5p dysregulation could contribute to the observed elevated vegfa levels in scc.
21816899_1	these reporter vectors carrying mutations in the target sites were insensitive to the effect of mir-1, mir-28-a, and mir-296-3p, proving that the modification of the target sites of creb1 3'utr is able to block the function of these mirna .
25536034_1	furthermore, bioinformatic prediction and experimental validation revealed that the anti-tumor effect of mir-503 was probably exerted through targeting and repressing of l1cam expression.
25536034_2	l1cam was up-regulated in osteosarcoma cell lines and primary tumor samples and the expression level of l1cam were negatively correlated with mir-503 levels in osteosarcoma tissues.
25536034_3	enforced expression of mir-503 remarkably reduced the luciferase activity of the reporter gene with the wild-type construct but not with the mutant l1cam3'utr construct, indicating mir-503 directly targeted the l1cam 3'utr.
26294080_2	these findings indicate that dicer-1 was a direct target of mir-107.
22710123_2	additionally, mir-21 also promoted dendritic cell apoptosis by targeting bcl-2.
22710123_3	mir-21 promoted apoptosis of dcs by targeting bcl-2.
22710123_4	overall, mir-21 was negatively correlated with il-12p35 mrna expression , suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of il12p35 by mir-21.
22710123_6	as shown in fig.6c, mir-21 mimics suppressed bcl-2 mrna and protein expression in bcg-infected bmdcs, while the mir-21 inhibitor showed the opposite effect, revealing an inverse correlation between bcl2 and mir-21 expression.
20371610_1	further, we identified foxo3a as a direct target of mir-155.
20371610_2	sustained overexpression of mir-155 resulted in repression of foxo3a protein without changing mrna levels, and knockdown of mir-155 increases foxo3a. in conclusion, our study reveals a molecular link between mir-155 and foxo3a and presents evidence that mir-155 is a critical therapeutic targetin breast cancer.
20371610_3	foxo3a is negatively regulated by mir-155.
20371610_4	these data indicate that mir-155 directly target foxo3a 3'utr at the mir-155-foxo3a response element to repress foxo3a protein expression.
20864407_1	these include mir- 125a and mir-125b, shown to directly regulate erbb2 in breast cancer cells but not in prostate cancer cells , mir-205, which regulates erbb3 expression in breast cancer cells , and mir-331-3p which directly regulates erbb2 by virtue of its specific binding to two separate targetsites .
25266720_1	here, we show that tumor suppressor mir-125a directly binds to the 3'utr of esrra and represses its expression.
19398468_1	this downregulation of mir-133 and mir-590 partly accounts for the upregulation of tgf-beta1 and tgf-betarii, because our data established tgf-beta1 and tgf-betarii as target for mir-133 and mir-590 repression.
19398468_2	we subsequently evaluated the ability of mir-133 to repress tgf--beta1 expression and of mir-590 to repress tgf--betarii expression.

22194605_2	mir-29a may inhibit epididymal epithelial cell proliferation during postnatal epididymal development by targeting nasp.
25483041_1	therefore, we further examined whether the alteration in mir-663 expression indeed had an effect on the expression of tgfb1.
25483041_2	as shown in figures 4a and b, overexpression of mir-663 led to suppression of tgfb1 at both mrna and protein levels.
25483041_4	furthermore, overexpression of mir-663 in hela cells markedly abolished the induction of tgf--beta1 with 4 gy irradiation .
25483041_5	moreover, though addition of tgf--beta1 as well as transfection of mir-663 inhibitors reduced cell survival rate, the combination of mir-663 inhibitor transfection and tgf--beta1 neutralizing antibody treatment led to a cell survival fraction that was comparable to that of the non-treated control , suggesting an interplay exists between mir-663 and tgf--beta1.
21430074_1	the mir-101 levels showed an inverse correlation with cox-2 protein expression in all 5 cell lines .
21430074_2	cox-2 as a direct target for mir-101 regulation was determined by using a luciferase reporter assay.
21430074_3	the results indicate that mir-101 does not affect cox-2 mrna transcription.
21430074_4	these data suggest that mir-101 suppresses cox-2 protein expression by directly binding to the 3'utr of cox-2 mrna.
21430074_5	interestingly, the inhibitory function of mir-101 on cox-2 expression can be reversed by introduction of the 3'utr fragment of cox-2 .
21430074_6	cox-2 protein levels were significantly lower in bph1cmir101 cells than in bph1cvec cells; however, the protein level of cox-2 in bph1cmir101 cells was significantly recovered by introducing 3'utr of cox-2 fragments . in conclusion, mir-101 negatively regulates cox-2 protein expression by specifically binding to the 3'utr of the cox-2 mrna region.
21743493_1	in particular, we demonstrate that satb1 is not only a direct target of foxp3 repression, but that foxp3 also induces two mirs, mir-7 and mir-155, which specifically target the 3'utr of satb1 to further regulate its expression.
21743493_2	we observed similar mir-7 and mir-155 downregulation of satb1 3'utr reporter construct activity in mda-mb-231 cells, a second breast cancer line known to express high levels of satb1 .
21743493_3	these observations suggest that the satb1 3' -utr contains functional binding sites for mir-7 and mir-155, and together the level of these two mirs contribute to the overall level of satb1 within the cell.
21743493_4	together, these findings suggest that foxp3 acts to negatively regulate satb1 levels both directly, through repression of satb1 transcription, and indirectly through the induction of mir-7 and mir-155 that then target the 3'utr of the satb1 mrna.

21867514_3	ctbp2 has one mir-141 targetsite and one mir-200c targetsite, while zeb1 and cdyl have two mir-200c targetsites.
21867514_4	rcor3 has one mir-141 targetsite.
21867514_5	although the expression of cdyl and rcor3 is less obviously affected by overexpression of mir-141 and mir-200c in panc-1 cells as compared to ctbp2 and zeb1 , we observed a downregulation of cdyl and rcor3 on the protein level, when mir-141 or mir-200c were transiently transfected in panc-1 cells ,4d, suggesting that cdyl and rcor3 are also target of the mir141-200c cluster.

21915288_3	ptgs2 mrna expression levels, however, in both aecs and amcs were not significantly changed by mir-143 transfection.
21915288_4	these results suggested that mir-143 regulation of ptgs2 expression occurs largely by translational inhibition than by ptgs2 mrna degradation in the amnion, particularly in amcs.

26782975_3	this result confirmed that bmp4 is a direct target of mirna-378.
26782975_4	this indicates that the downregulation of bmp4 mimics the function of mirna-378 on myogenic differentiation of c2c12 cells, further indicating that mirna-378 regulates myogenic differentiation by downregulating bmp4.
26622903_1	these data demonstrated that mir- 195 inhibits the expression of ccnd2 and myb in hela cells.
26622903_2	the results showed that mir- 195, but not the nc, specifically decreased the luciferase levels from the reporters , suggesting that mir- 195 regulates the expression of ccnd2 and myb directly.
26622903_3	the present study demonstrated that mir-195 directly targeted the 3'utr of the myb gene and inhibited its expression in hela cells, suggesting that the deregulation of mir-195-mediated myb inhibition may serve as a general mechanism in the development of a variety of cancers .
20947829_1	using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that mir-218 directly represses the expression of robo1, robo2, and glucuronyl c5-epimerase , and that an intact mir-218-slit-robo regulatory network is essential for normal vascularization of the retina.
20947829_2	we identified mir-218-1 and mir-218-2 within intron 14 of the mouseslit2 and slit3 genes, respectively .
20947829_3	the activity of the luciferase reporter linked to the robo1, robo2, and glce 3'-utrs, normalized to -beta-galactosidase activity, displayed dose-dependent repression by mir-218 .
20947829_4	furthermore, our results suggest that robo1 2 and glce positively influence the migration rate of ec cells in culture and that mir-218 counteracts this process.
20947829_5	importantly, the mrna and protein levels of robo1, robo2, and glce were enhanced by mir-218 knockdown in the retina , although robo2 mrna levels were not significantly affected by mir-218 knockdown .

23543060_2	these results are consistent with computational predictions excluding these genes as targets for mir-26 and indicate that the effect of mir-26 on kcnj2 kir2.1 ik1 is target specific.
22307404_1	to confirm that the decrease in the luciferase activity was indeed due to the direct binding of mir-125b to arid3b 3'utr, c1-mut construct was generated.
22307404_5	no significant decrease in cell proliferation was noted in arid3b silenced cells compared to arid3b expressing mcf7 , indicating that mir-125b targeting of arid3b was important for cell migration behavior changes.
21668589_2	this raises a possibility that the down-regulation of mir126 triggers the upregulation of spred1.
21668589_5	these results strongly support our hypothesis that mir126 regulates fcepsilonri-mediated cytokine production by directly targeting spred1 in mast cells.

26458304_3	these data suggest that pdgfralpha is one of the direct targets of mir-219-5p.
26458304_4	the increased endogenous mir-219-5p levels were associated with significantly decreased endogenous pdgfralpha mrna and protein expression.
26458304_5	transfection with 150 pmol of mir-219-5p inhibitor showed a decrease of mir-219-5p expression and an increase pdgfralpha mrna and protein expression compared with the inhibitor control.
23085654_1	in this study, we found that the expression of ghr mrna and protein was regulated by transfected bta-mir-15a synthetics.
23085654_2	the lactogenic activity of gh may be elicited directly through the activation of stat5 followed by the activation of milk protein gene transcription in alveolar cells , so we suggest that the operative mechanism was that mir-15a deregulated ghr, affected jak2-stat5 signal pathway and decreased the expression of -beta-casein.
23085654_4	the present study showed that bta-mir-15a negatively regulated the expression of ghr, confirming the prediction by bioinformatics that the ghr gene could be a potential target of bta-mir-15a.

23569431_2	taken together, our results suggest that mir-34a could inhibit osteosarcoma growth via the down regulation of eag1 expression.
23569431_3	these results suggest that the tumor suppressor activity of mir-34a is mediated through negative regulation of oncogenic protein eag1.

23663545_1	interestingly,we demonstrated that mir-141, which was more highly induced by h5n1 than by h1n1 , had an ability to suppress the expression of a cytokine - transforming growth factor -beta2.since tgf-beta2 is an important cytokine that can act as both an immunosuppressive agent and a potent proinflammatory molecule through its ability to attract and regulate inflammatory molecules, and previous report showed that only seasonal influenza h1n1 could induce a persistent expression of tgf-beta2, we speculate that the modulation of tgf-beta2 expression by different influenza subtypes via mir-141 might be a critical step for determining the outcome of either normal or excessive inflammation progression.
26265044_2	the result of a dual-luciferase activity assay using the 3'utr of apaf-1 also indicated that mir-17 significantly decreased the expression of luciferase, demonstrating that mir-17 targets the 3'utr of apaf-1 .

21305018_3	the second construct additionally contained four mir-29 mres, and was significantly responsive to both mirna precursors, indicating a specific effect of mir-15 and mir-29 mres in the cds of murineeln.
21305018_4	in addition, col1a2 has neither mir-15 nor mir-29 mres in its 3'utr and was responsive to both mir mimics.
21305018_5	although col1a1 has one mir-15 and one mir-29 mre in its 3'utr, the great majority of mres for these mirnas are located in its cds.
24183204_1	we found that mir-184 expression was significantly high in hcc tissues, but inppl1 expression was obviously low.
24183204_2	subsequently, inppl1 was identified as a target of mirna-184 by bioinformatics and dual luciferase assay.

14617150_3	as shown, ryhb basepairing to the rbs of sodb mrna could potentially prevent ribosome biding.
14617150_4	the complementarity between bases -2, -3 and -6 of sodb mrna and bases 44, 45 and 49 of ryhb seems to be essential for their interaction.
14617150_5	it should be noted that this regulatory cascade does not entail a direct action of hfq on sodb mrna.
22484120_1	gsk-3-beta messenger rna was identified as a direct target of mir-26a by computational analysis and experimental assays.
22484120_2	mir-26a-mediated reduction of gsk-3-beta resulted in activation of -beta-catenin and induction of several downstream genes including c-myc, cyclind1, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor -beta.
22484120_3	this approach led us to identify mir-26a as a noncoding rna that directly binds the 3- -untranslated region of the gsk-3-beta mrna.
22484120_4	these results demonstrate that gsk-3-beta is a direct target of mir-26a.
22484120_5	our findings are consistent with a recent study by mohamed et al showing that mir-26a target gsk-3-beta in human airway smooth muscle cells.
26396496_1	dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that mir-133b interacted with the 3'-untranslated region of gst-π.
26396496_2	compared to controls, the mrna and protein levels of mdr1 and gst-π were downregulated after mir-133b transfection and upregulated after anti-mir-133b transfection.
26396496_3	these results indicate that mir-133b directly binds to the 3'utr of wild type gst-π.
20435894_1	this inhibitory effect of il-10 on mir-155 led to an increase in the expression of the mir-155 target ship1.
20435894_2	the fact that lps potently induces mature mir-155 suggests that as mir-155 expression increases, its ability to bindto the 3'utr of ship1 should result in a decrease of ship1 mrna expression.
24958806_3	furthermore, we demonstrate that mir216a exerts its role by directly targeting eif4b and zeb1.
25594002_2	up-regulation of mir-34a was correlated with down-regulation of its target e2f3 and up-regulation of p53.

26919700_2	mir-126 inhibited the -beta-cell proliferation through irs-2 instead of irs-1.
26919700_3	mir-126 may take part in the glucose homeostasis both through its target irs-2 and irs-1.
26919700_4	this result demonstrated that the three nucleotides uac was crucial for the binding of mir-126 with the irs-2.
26919700_5	in general, the above results indicated that irs-2 was one of the target genes of mir-126.
26919700_6	together with the up-regulation wave of the endogenous mir-126, the expression of irs-2 and irs-1 mrna displayed a different mode of changes.
20066053_1	we found that, in both cortical precursors and their neuronal progenies, emx2 antisense rna contributes to post-transcriptional down-regulation of its sense partner, possibly by a dicer-promoted mechanism.interestingly,
20066053_3	remarkably, knock-down of emx2os induced by mir-alphaemx2os-774 rescued the emx2-mrna decrease to large extent , suggesting that emx2os-ncrna substantially contributes to emx2 down-regulation at the time when cp neurons are born.
26791102_1	first, mir-214 directly targeted atf4, a crucial transcriptional factor involved in anti-stress responses, down regulation of mir-214 releases the repression of atf4 translation and leads to increased atf4 protein content.
26791102_2	all considered, these data support a direct regulation of atf4 by mir-214 through a posttranscriptional mechanism at its 3'utr.
26791102_3	we here presented a novel function of mir-214 in protecting cells from oxidative stress-associated cell death through interlinking nrf2 and atf4, ezh2 bim signaling in erythroid cells.

25875420_2	using a luciferase assay, we found that mir-138-5p directly targets foxc1.
25875420_3	inaddition, we found that exogenous over-expression of mir-138-5p inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth, both in vitro and in vivo, and that sirna-mediated silencing of foxc1, a direct target of mir-138-5p, similarly inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth.
25875420_4	to test this hypothesis, we used a luciferase assay and, by doing so, confirmed that mir-138-5p indeed directly targets foxc1 .
26285119_1	meanwhile, we also demonstrated that gm-csf was a main inducer of mir-200c in tumor environment, and mir-200c in turn promoted the expansion and immune suppressive activity of mdscs via targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog and friend of gata 2 , which can lead to stat3 and pi3k akt activation.
26285119_2	here we show that mir-200c, whose genomic locus is located in fragile regions within two chromosomal clusters, including mir-200c-141 cluster and mir-200b-200a-429 cluster, strongly promotes the suppressive potential of mdscs via targeting pten and fog2, leading to subsequent stat3 and pi3k akt activation.
26285119_3	importantly, the mutation in the putative mir-200c binding sites abolished the repression by mir-200c, demonstrating that mir-200c could specifically target their binding sites in the 3'utr of pten.
26285119_4	taken together, these data demonstrate that mir-200c targets and reduces the levels of pten and fog2 in mdscs.
23393589_1	these data support the notion that over-expression of mir-130a 301a 454 leads to smad4 down-regulation, thus inhibiting tgf--beta signaling-mediated cell growth suppression, which contributes to the development of colon cancer.
23393589_2	these results further demonstrated that the growth-promoting roles of mir-130a 301a 454 were mainly through inhibition of smad4 expression.
25095979_1	in western blot and luciferase assays, hmgb3 was identified as a major target of mir-513b.
25095979_2	moreover, we also found that the expression of hmgb3 lacking in 3'utr could abrogate the anti-migration and pro-apoptosis function of mir-513b.
25095979_3	these findings suggest the importance of mir-513b targeting of hmgb3 in the regulation of growth, migration and apoptosis of gc, improve our understanding of the mechanisms of gc pathogenesis, and may promote the development of novel targeted therapies.
25910896_1	bcl2 is a target of mir34a in idd and mir-34a repressed expression of bcl-2.
25910896_2	transfection of the mutant bcl2 3'utr with the same constructs had no effect on luciferase activity, confirming that bcl2 is a direct target of mir34a.

20103531_4	as in the western blot analysis, when mir-205 was overexpressed, pten mrna levels decreased by approximately 50% as compared with the luciferase shrna control .
20103531_5	collectively, these results indicate that mir-205 regulates pten expression.
20103531_6	mir-205 target the mrna of the tumor-suppressor protein pten.
26825461_1	we inhibited mir-142- 5p and mir-143 in thp-1 cells using antagomir oligonucleotides and measured the expression of six pyrogens: il6st, ifna1, tnf, tlr2, il6 and pge2 by rt-qpcr .4d. of these, three targets il6, ifna1 and pge2, were expressed at levels below the detection limit of rt-qpcr pre- and post-knockdown of either mirna.
26825461_2	we confirmed that mir-142- 5p and mir-143 regulated the expression of il6st and tlr2 respectively .4d.
20727858_1	important antiapoptotic bcl-2 was identified to be directly targeted by mir-195, and mir-195 was further suggested to exert its proapoptotic function mainly through targeting bcl-2 expression.
26313916_2	taken together, these experiments provided clear and strong evidence that mir-26a acted as a physiological regulator in mouse adult sensory neurons to maintain gsk3-beta at a lower level.
26313916_3	taken together, these results indicated that gsk3-beta was the major target of mir-26a in adult mouse sensory neurons that functioned to control axon regeneration.
26313916_4	therefore, the result here suggests that mir-26a control axon regeneration via gsk3-beta by targeting gene expression at the neuronal soma.

26758252_3	these data demonstrated that mir-24 is an important regulator of bcl2l11 in gc cells, and mir-24 regulates bcl2l11 expression by directly targeting the 3'utr of bcl2l11 mrna.
20232393_1	ectopic transfection of mir-138 reduced the expression of both rhoc and rock2 in tscc cells.
20232393_2	these results suggested that mir-138 regulates rhoc gene expression, at least in part, by regulating the stability of rhoc mrna.
20232393_3	furthermore, as shown in figure 2c, ectopic transfection of mir-138 reduced the protein level of rhoc in um1 cells, and knockdown of mir-138 using anti-mir-138 pna increased the protein level of rhoc in um2 cells.
20232393_4	as illustrated in figure 4, our results suggest a novel paradigm in which mir-138 regulates rhoc-specific gtpase signaling cascade by targeting both rhoc and rock2 mrnas concurrently and suppresses their expression at posttranscriptional levels.
22028919_1	both mir-101 and mir-494 synthetic mimics significantly inhibited the expression of a reporter construct containing the 3'utr of cftr in luciferase assays.
22028919_2	thus, mir-101 and mir-494 functionally interact with the cftr 3'utr and suppress the corresponding protein product.
22664106_1	up-regulation of mir-26a promotes apoptosis of hypoxic ratneonatal cardiomyocytes by repressing gsk-3-beta protein expression.
22664106_2	we identified gsk3b as a direct downstream target of mir-26a.
22664106_3	to test whether gsk-3-beta is a mir-26a targetgene in cardiomyocytes, we have confirmed that h2o2 decreases gsk-3-beta expression in cultured cardiomyocytes and .
22664106_4	mir-26a is able to bindto gsk-3-beta and regulate its expression directly using a construct in which a fragment of the 3 its exprgsk-3-beta mrna with the putative mir-26a binding sequence.
22664106_5	this result indicates that gsk-3-beta is indeed a functional targetgene of mir-26a that is involved in mir-26a-mediated pro-apoptotic effect on cardiomyocyte injury elicited by h2o2.
22664106_6	for this reason, we suggest that mir-26a induced apoptosis in h2o2-stimulated cardiomyocytes by post-transcriptional regulation of gsk-3-beta.

26854065_1	in addition, the down-regulation of mir-200b in endometriosis is associated with a reduction on klf4 expression.
20881232_2	mir-631 inhibitor enhanced both sult1a1 mrna and protein levels in mcf7 and mcf10a cells .
20881232_3	thus, variant alleles in the sult1a1 3'utr affect the binding ability of mir-631 to sult1a1 but not the abundance of mir-631 .
24257599_1	mir-bart16 also inhibited plsg-lmp1nt671 but not plsg-lmp1nt692, indicating that mir-bart16 targets the 5'region of the lmp1 3'utr.
19404929_1	when we tested the effect of mir-124a on cdk-2 expression by transfection of pre-mir-124a into primary ra fls and e11 cells, we found that overexpression of mir-124a substantially suppressed the expression of cdk-2 in both cell types .
19404929_2	as shown in figure 4d, mir-124a selectively suppressed the luciferase activity driven by the wild-type 3'utr, but not the mutant form, of cdk-2 mrna, indicating that cdk-2 mrna is a direct target of mir-124a.
23857777_1	further analysis of mir-373 in vivo oncogenic function reveals that it is mediated through its negative regulation of tp53inp1, lats2 and cd44.
23857777_2	as shown in fig 5a and b, tp53inp1, lats2 and cd44 levels were significantly reduced in mia paca-2 cells transfected with pre-恗ir373; while all three proteins were increased in mia paca-2 cells transfected with anti-373, indicating a direct post-恡ranscriptional regulation of those three target genes by mir-373. in addition, this study provides a comprehensive mechanism for zip4-恗ediated pancreatic cancer growth involving creb-恉ependent transcription, enhancement of oncogenic mir-373 expression, and reduction in key mir-373 regulated targets, including the tumour suppressor genes tp53inp1, lats2 and cd44.

26261543_1	moreover, we demonstrated that mir-218 directly binds to the 3'utr of hmgb1 gene.
26261543_3	these data suggested that mir-218 could directly target the 3'utr sequences of hmgb1.
26261543_4	these results agree with the fact that mir-22 regulates hmgb1 by targeting the 3'utr of it and suppressing its translation.
26261543_5	in conclusion, our results revealed that hmgb1 was directly targeted by mir-218, and overexpressed mir-218 could suppress the hmgb1 level, and block the hmgb1-mediated autophagy in drug-treated ec cells.
21750350_1	fancg is the mir-23a targetgene.
21750350_2	to determine whether mir-23a affected the expression of the fancg gene, we performed immunoblotting analysis and found that the fancg protein was considerably decreased in the ectopic expression of pre-mir-23a, following ane exposure . in contrast, knockdown of mir-23a restored expression of the fancg protein following ane exposure .

21068409_2	the results reveal that transfection of mir-101 mimic but not control dsrna markedly inhibits the production of mkp-1 protein .
21068409_4	mir-101 represses mkp-1 expression through interaction with the 3'utr of mkp-1.
21068409_5	transfection with mir-101 mimics markedly inhibited the luciferase activity for the wild-type 3'utr of mkp-1 but showed no repression effect for the mutated 3'utr of mkp-1 when compared with that for the control dsrna , suggesting that mir-101 may repress mkp-1 expression by binding to the 3'utr of mkp-1 in a direct and sequence-specific manner.
21068409_6	these results suggest that mir-101 may regulate the lps-induced activation of jnk or p38 through targeting mkp-1.
21068409_7	these results indicate that mir-101 can be induced by different tlr ligands and may play a role in the innate immune responses to microbial infection through targeting mkp-1.
23201159_1	these results suggest that mir-145 regulates downstream molecules via targeting n-ras and irs1.
23201159_3	these results indicate that mir-145 inhibits vegf transcriptional activation through targeting both n-ras and irs1 that are functional.
23201159_4	meanwhile, the activation of akt and erk1 2 signaling pathways and the expression of hif-1alpha were significantly suppressed by mir-145 .
23201159_5	vegf, the downstream target of akt and erk1 2, was also inhibited by mir-145 overexpression when compared to negative control , demonstrating that in an animal model, mir-145 can inhibit akt and erk1 2 activation by targeting n-ras and irs1, thus suppressing the downstream molecules hif-1 and vegf, which are involved in tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth.
20657750_3	therefore, it appears that mir-29b does not affect mmp-2 mrna expression.
20657750_4	mir-29b target matrix metallopeptidase-2 and represses pro-mmp-2 protein expression.
21946562_1	interestingly, among the already experimentally confirmed targets of the mir-34 family is the sirt1 mrna , that has two binding sites of mir-34c .
21946562_2	as shown by the respective luciferase assays in supplementary figure s4d, targeting of sirt1 mrna by mir-34c applies also to neuronal cells.
21946562_3	administration of mir-34c sirt1 target protector was able to rescue mir-34c mimic-mediated learning impairment and resulted in increased sirt1 protein levels , thus confirming that action of mir-34c on sirt1 protein in vivo is direct and based on mir-34c mrna interaction.
21946562_4	mir-34c induced impairment of associative learning corresponded with reduced sirt1 levels , confirming successful incorporation of mir-34c mimic into the risc complex and specific translational repression of target mrnas.
21946562_5	furthermore, specific blocking of the interaction between mir-34c and its sirt1 3'utr binding sites through mirna target protectors was able to reverse the above effects.
26700675_1	importantly, we identified that the 3- -untranslated region of itga2 was a direct target of mir-128.

26700675_3	collectively, these results reveal the negative regulatory role of mir-128 to itga2 in mg-63 cells. in addition, we identified itga2 as a direct target gene of mir-128, suggesting that mir-128 played a suppressor role in osteosarcoma tumorigenesis.
19158788_1	thbs1 mrna was downregulated in cells engineered to express kshv mirnas and also showed that thbs1 translation is inhibited by several kshv mirnas, in particular by mir-k12-6-3p, which shows mirna seed complementarity to two sites in the thbs1 mrna 3'utr. .
17881434_1	we observed a significant inhibition of luciferase from reporters containing the 3'utrs of ldoc1, matr3, and tm6sf1 in the presence of mir-155 or mir-k12-11. in contrast, neither mirna had any effect on the phf17 or nfat2cip 3'utrs.
17881434_2	thus, these assays confirmed ldoc1, matr3, and tm6sf1 as being targets of both mir-155 and mir-k12-11.
19585654_1	here, using a global microarray-based mirna profiling approach followed by validation with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we have demonstrated that conserved mir-181 family members were up-regulated in epcam afp hccs and in epcam hcc cells isolated from afp tumors.
19585654_3	importantly, inhibition of mir-181 led to a reduction in epcam hcc cell quantity and tumor initiating ability, whereas exogenous mir-181 expression in hcc cells resulted in an enrichment of epcam hcc cells.
19585654_5	taken together, our results define a novel regulatory link between mir-181s and human epcam liver cancer stem progenitor cells and imply that molecular targeting of mir-181 may eradicate hcc.
23829529_1	the first example includes a nat complementary to zeb2 mrna and its expression promotes the retention of a large intron at the 5- -end of the sense transcript.

19302977_2	so we checked whether these two mir-21 target were regulated by mir-21 in prostate cancer cells.
19302977_4	s2, antimir-21 significantly increased the pdcd4 and tpm1 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner.
26634745_1	bioinformatics analyses showed that mir-4262 targeted the 3'utr of opn mrna to inhibit its translation, which was proved by luciferase reporter assay.
21611182_1	to determine whether genes identified in pc12 cells also were regulated by mir-132 knockdown in vivo, we used il-6 as a test case because of its involvement in nervous system function .
21829663_1	for example, mir-23a and -125a up-regulation as well as mir-19a b down-regulation by both hbx forms were verified.the
21753737_1	figure 4a illustrates the approximate binding sites of mir-132 and mir-21 within the -beta2-subunit 3'utr region.

19188590_1	mir-182 over-expression promotes migration and survival by directly repressing microphthalmia-associated transcription factor-m and foxo3.
19188590_2	further evidence that endogenous mir-182 actively blocks foxo3 and mitf in melanoma cells came from our observation that transfection of anti-mir-182 oligonucleotides results in foxo3 and mitf up-regulation .
19188590_3	finally, concomitant over-expression of mir-182 and either foxo3 or mitf-m abolished the stimulatory effect of mir-182 on the invasive capacity of melanoma cells , demonstrating that foxo3 and mitf repression are necessary effectors of mir-182.
20439467_1	mir-340 interacts with two of its targetsites on the 3'utr of mitf mrna,causing mrna degradation and decreased expression and activity of mitf.
20439467_2	moreover, inhibition of mir-340 function in 451lu cells also increased the mitf protein level .

19278969_1	lmo2 is a direct targetfor mir-223.
19278969_3	importantly, mutation of six bases in the candidate mir-223 binding site totally abrogated mir-223-dependent repression.
19278969_4	the observed smaller decrease in lmo2 mrna compared to lmo2 protein might be the result of mirna- mediated mrna-decay coupled to translational repression.
19278969_5	these experiments demonstrate that mir-223 directly interacts with the lmo2 3'utr.
19278969_6	as shown in figure 5a the enforced expression of mir-223 resulted in degradation of lmo2 mrna and in a decrease of about 60% of lmo2 protein levels.
23069713_2	we also discovered that luciferase activity is exclusively decreased by targeting egfr in hmscs transfected with mir-133a mimic.
23069713_3	these results indicate that the egfr is a target of mir-133a, which binds to the 3'utr region of human egfr mrna.
26272182_3	these observations implicate that ang is a potential mediator in tumor-induced downregulation of mir-542-3p in ecs.
26272182_5	indeed, higher ang expression correlated with lower mir-542-3p expression , indicating the downregulation of mir-542-3p by ang in breast cancer patients.
21725369_1	previous studies have shown that bmi1 is a target gene of both mir-200 and mir-15 .
21725369_2	to confirm whether mir-200b and mir-15b target to bmi1 in tscc cells, we conducted luciferase reporter assays by evaluating the relative luciferase activities in the cells transfected with a reporter plasmid carrying mir-200b or mir-15b target sequence versus those transfected with a control plasmid.
21725369_3	however, when the mirna targeting sequence was mutated in the reporter plasmids, transfection with mimics of mir-200b or mir-15b did not influence the relative luciferase activity , suggesting that mir-200b and mir-15b directly suppress bmi1 translation in tscc cells.
21725369_5	figure 5 mir-200b and mir-15b regulate emt in cal27-res cells by targeting to bmi1.
21725369_6	collectively, these data suggest that mir-200b and mir-15b regulate chemotherapy-induced emt of tscc cells by targeting bmi1.
21725369_7	these findings suggest that mir-200b and mir-15b inhibit the metastasis of tscc in vivo probably via silencing bmi1.
22956257_1	our data showed pten mrna and protein levels were significantly increased in ir adipocytes compared with normal adipocytes, over-expression of mir-21 significantly decreased pten protein level, whereas it had no significant effect on pten mrna expression in ir-adipocytes.
22956257_2	these data indicated that pten was a target gene of mir-21 in 3t3-l1 adipocytes .
22956257_3	taken together, these results suggested the inhibition of pten expression by mir-21 led to activation of the pi3k akt pathway without perturbing pten upstream signaling molecules.
21982894_1	the mature mir-155 binds to the 3'utr of bach1 mrna and inhibits the translation of bach1 protein.
22383162_1	luciferase assays and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that mir-506 specifically may bindthe 3'untranslated region of ae2 messenger rna and prevent protein translation.
22383162_2	luciferase assays and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that mir-506 specifically may bindthe 3'utr region of ae2 mrna and prevent protein translation.
21586237_1	mir-221 222 were downregulated by endoplasmic reticulum stress in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which subsequently protected human hepatocellular carcinoma cells against endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis through p27kip1 regulation.
25818238_1	also, mir-124 targeted polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 , which is a splicer of pyruvate kinase muscle 1 and 2 and induced the switching of pkm isoforms expression from pkm2 to pkm1.
21273303_1	mir-21 was identified as an mir expression signature of rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis that down-regulates programmed cell death 4 protein levels.
21273303_2	pdcd4, a target of mir-21, mrna expression was detectable by rt-pcr analysis , but pdcd4 protein was not detected by immunoblotting analysis in control cells , compatible with mir-21 regulation of pdcd4 expression in bmms at the posttranscriptional level.
21273303_3	pdcd4 protein levels were extremely up-regulated by mir-21 silencing compared with control .
21273303_4	taken together, the action of mir-21 to suppress pdcd4 protein expression levels in bmms is a prerequisite for induction of osteoclastic transcription factors, specific markers, and osteoclastogenesis. in addition, elevated pdcd4 protein expression levels by decreased mir-21 expression were remarkably attenuated by mir-21 overexpression, indicating that expression of mir-21 for down-regulation of pdcd4 is physiologically pivotal in osteoclastogenesis.
21273303_5	thus, osteopetrosis in dicer cko mice may be caused by impaired mir-21 levels and up-regulated pdcd4 protein levels in bmms.
26847831_1	in addition, both targetscan 5.2 and pictar gave high confidence predictions that cul5 would be a target of mir-182.
26847831_2	this prediction was supported by an evolutionarily deep conservation of two mir-182 binding sites in the cul5 3'utr.
26847831_3	thus, at least in these two cancers, cul5 is a target of mir-182 such that cul5 downregulation is achieved, in part, through modulation of mir-182 expression.
21307095_1	through specific interactions with cognate sequences in the barx1 3'untranslated region, mir-7a and mir-203 repress barx1 expression in stomachmesenchymal cells and its function in inducing gastric epithelium.
21307095_2	thus, different computational algorithms predict barx1 mrna as a targetfor mir-7a and mir-203, which are expressed in a tissue-specific and temporal pattern compatible with a role in barx1 regulation.
21307095_3	to test whether mir-7a and mir-203 affect endogenous barx1 levels in a native context, we forced pre-mir expression in ismcs or cultured fresh e12 mousestomach mesenchymal cells without luciferase reporter genes.
21307095_4	both mir-7a and mir-203 reduced barx1 protein levels in these experiments, confirming mirna targeting of barx1 .
21307095_5	these data directly implicate mir-7a and mir-203 in regulating barx1 expression levels through the 3'utr.
23185467_2	further, several micrornas, specifically mir-101, mir-1668 and mir-1681 were discovered to influence serpinb3 expression via its 3'utr which suggests that post-transcriptional regulation influences serpinb3 expression in chickens.

22508041_2	expression of mir-155 was markedly reduced and that of c-jun mrna and protein was significantly up-regulated in uva-irradiated hdfs.
22508041_3	mir-155 directly controls c-jun expression in hdfs at the post-transcriptional level and might function as a protective mirna in hdfs.c-jun is a direct targetgene of mir-155.
22508041_4	luciferase reporter assays were performed to examine whether a mir-155 binding site in the 3'- untranslated region of the c-jun gene is responsible for mir-155-mediated c-jun regulation in hek293a cells.
26589799_1	herein, we identify mgat4a, ogt and galnt13 as targets of mir-424.
26589799_3	overall, our data demonstrates that mir-424 can regulate mgat4a, ogt and galnt13 through binding to their 3'-utrs.
26589799_4	taken together this data argues that mgat4a is a direct target of endogenous mir-424.
26020803_1	in consistence, we found a higher mir-155 level and a lower foxo3a level in aspc-1 cells compared with capan-2 cells, indicating an inverse link between mir-155 and foxo3a . in contrast, mir-155 did not affect the luciferase activity in both cell lines transfected with mutated 3'utr region of foxo3a, indicating direct binding of mir-155 to foxo3a in pancreatic cancer cells.
26020803_2	the current study showed that ectopic expression of mir-155 targets foxo3a, leading to decrease of two major antioxidants including sod2 and catalase.
26701852_1	the results reported herein show that prdm16 was inhibited by mir-101 directly and also through epigenetic regulation.
26701852_2	prdm16 was confirmed as a new target of mir-101 and shown to be directly inhibited by mir-101.
26701852_3	mir-101 also decreased the expression of prdm16 by altering the methylation status of the prdm16 promoter.
26701852_4	in addition, ezh2, eed and dnmt3a were identified as direct targets of mir-101, and mir-101 suppressed prdm16 expression by targeting dnmt3a which decreases histone h3k27me3 and h3k4me2 at the prdm16 core promoter.
26701852_5	we concluded that the 3'utr of prdm16 is directly targeted by mir-101 at the predicted binding site.
26701852_6	thus, prdm16 may be considered a new target of mir-101 in astrocytoma cell lines.
26701852_7	these data indicated that mir-101 suppressed prdm16 expression via dnmt3a-mediated modifications of histone h3k27me3 and h3k4me2 at the prdm16 core promoter, and these effects did not occur though ezh2 and eed.
22264793_1	mir-31 negatively regulates the noncanonical nf-kappab pathway by targeting nf-kappab inducing kinase .
22264793_2	mir-31 inhibition inversely rescued the nik level, revealing that the cellular mir-31 level negatively affected that of the nik protein through its 3'utr sequence.
22264793_3	these lines of evidence collectively demonstrated that mir-31 recognizes and regulates nik mrna through specific binding to its 3'utr. in contrast, mir-31 inhibition resulted in accumulation of nik mrna and protein in hela cells .
22264793_4	taking together all these results, mir-31, which is almost completely absent in primary atl cells, appears to play a critical role in negative regulation of the nf-kb pathway by manipulating the expression of nik.
22264793_5	collectively, these findings indicate that mir-31 mediates apoptosis through repression of nik in atl cell lines.

26081620_3	when co-transfected with mir-219-5p, only the wide type of robo1 3'utr-driven luciferase but not mutant one showed a significant reduction in the luciferase activity ,indicatingthat the robo1mrna isa bona fide mir-219-5p target.
26081620_4	interestingly, in individual tumor sample, the level of mir-219-5p was negatively correlated with the level of robo1 , again supporting the robo1 is a direct target of mir-219-5p in gliomas.

20869334_3	these results suggest that mir-100 inhibited atm expression in m059j cells by targeting the specific b1 site of the 3'utr of atm.
20869334_4	these results confirm that up-regulating mir-100 in m059k cells induced radiosensitization is the consequence of the low-expression of atm. in summary, our data, to the best of our knowledge, demonstrate for the first time that atm is the target of mir-100, and indicate that over-expression of mir-100 is mainly responsible for the low expression of atm in m059j cells.
20869334_5	these data also demonstrate that mir-100 targeting atm could sensitize the cells to ir-induced killing.
21622680_1	the effect of mir-195 on apoptosis is mediated through down-regulation of sirt1 and bcl-2 and ros production.
24452416_1	in the pre-mir-222 transfection group showed increased expression of mir-222 and decreased expression of puma, enhanced proliferation and invasion abilities, and decreased apoptosis.
25087183_1	subsequently, we showed that the upregulation of mir-21 was mediated by hbx-induced interleukin-6 pathway followed by activation of stat3 transcriptional factor.
26129688_1	here, our aim was to determine if mir-193b targets cyclin d1 in prostate cancer.
26129688_3	we found reduced mir-193b expression in stage pt3 tumors compared to pt2 tumors in a cohort of prostatectomy specimens.
26129688_4	in 22rv1 pc cells with low endogenous mir-193b expression, the overexpression of mir-193b reduced ccnd1 mrna levels and cyclin d1 protein levels.
26129688_6	moreover, according to a reporter assay, mir-193b targeted the 3'utr of ccnd1 in pc cells and the ccnd1 activity was rescued by expressing ccnd1 lacking its 3'utr.
23372675_1	the effects of mir-221 were then assessed by cell viability, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assay, and cisplatin resistance assay. in both cells, upregulation of mir-221 induced cell survival and cisplatin resistance and reduced cell apoptosis.
23372675_4	moreover, luciferase reporter assay and western blot confirmed that pten was a direct target of mir-221.
19584283_1	we proved that, by modulating cyclin g1, mir-122 influences p53 protein stability and transcriptional activity and reduces invasion capability of hcc-derived cell lines.
19584283_2	in addition, in a therapeutic perspective, we assayed the effects of a restored mir-122 expression in triggering doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and we proved that mir-122, as well as cyclin g1 silencing, increases sensitivity to doxorubicin challenge.
19584283_3	in patients resected for hcc, lower mir-122 levels were associated with a shorter ttr, whereas higher cyclin g1 expression was related to a lower survival, suggesting that mir-122 might represent an effective molecular target for hcc.
21986534_1	this overexpression of mir-155 may suppress theexpression of c ebp-beta and creb by directly targeting their 3' untranslated regions .

21814748_1	in reporter assays,mir-34a binds its putative targetsite within the axl 3'utr to inhibit luciferase expression.
21814748_2	given the correlation between low levels of mir-34a expression in cell lines exhibiting high levels of axl, and the putative targetsite for mir-34a in the axl 3'utr, we hypothesize that axl is a direct molecular target of mir-34a.
21814748_3	fig. 2 mir-34a target the 3'utr of axl and affects expression of a luciferase reporter construct.
21814748_4	in comparison to negative control treated hs578t cells, a 60% reduction in axl protein levels was seen following transfection with the mir-34a mimic, but just a 30% decrease in c-met levels .
21814748_5	these data suggest that in both mda-mb-231 and hs578t breast cancer cell lines, the affinity of axl as a targetfor mir-34a appears to be greater than that of c-met.
21814748_6	this resulted in a recovery of phospho-akt levels and supports the targeting influence mir-34a has on axl.
26160158_1	mir-141 binds to h19 in a sequence specific manner, and suppesses h19 expression and functions including proliferation and invasion.
26160158_2	mutation of the putative mir-141 target sites decreased the response to mir-141, indicating that mir-141 binds to h19 in a sequence specific manner.
26160158_3	taken together, these data are consistent with our hypothesis and indicate that h19 may interact with mir-141 to link mir-141 and the post-transcriptional network in gastric pathogenesis.
23579289_1	as osx is a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation, we deduced that mir-214 might play a role in osteoblast differentiation to validate the prediction, a series of 3'utr fragments comprising that from the wt, d1, d2, and d3 osx.
23579289_2	these results suggested that mir-214 binds to the osx 3'utr directly and that both site 1 and site 2 are the binding sites of mir-214.
17569660_1	we further found that meg3 stimulates expression of the growth differentiation factor 15 by enhancing p53 binding to the gdf15 gene promoter.
17569660_3	these data indicate that specific rna folding is critical to meg3 activation of p53.
17569660_4	these data indicate that transfection of meg3 dna does not cause p53 activation.
17569660_5	instead, transcription of meg3 is required for p53 activation.
26692949_3	taken together, these data indicated that creb1 was a direct target of mir-205 in crc.
26692949_4	furthermore, we identified that creb1 was a direct target of mir-205, and decreased expression of creb1 have the similar effects of mir-205 restoration on proliferation, migration and invasion of crc cells.
26674874_1	mir-155-3p in cd4+ t cells targets dnaja2 and dnajb1.

18644370_1	our chip experiments also showed that over-expression of mir-17-92 did not obviously decrease the abundance of e2f1 on the ptpro promoter .
18644370_2	these data indicate that ptpro is a target of mir-17-92.
18644370_3	therefore, it is possible that the overexpressed e2f1 first up-regulated ptpro mrna and then down-regulated ptpro protein expression by up-regulating mir-17-92 transcription, leading to the above phenomenon in reporter assays.
18644370_4	e2f1 overexpression indeed upregulated mir-17-5p, a member of the mir-17-92 cluster .
18644370_5	to further validate the co-regulation of ptpro by e2f1 and mir-17-92 in cell cycle progression, we first monitored ptpro mrna expression in synchronized hela cells , and found that ptpro transcription was up-regulated during s phase .

18644370_7	these results indicated that the mir-17-5p binding site in the ptpro 3'utr reporter contributed to the inhibition of the reporter during late s phase.
18644370_8	therefore, our data suggeste a model where ptpro is co-regulated by e2f1 and mir-17-92.

26194496_1	the results showed that in both mrna and protein levels, up-regulation of mir-325 decreased hmgb1 expression; on the other hand, inhibition of mir-325 raised hmgb1 levels .
26194496_2	these results suggested that mir-325 modulates hmgb1 expression by directly targeting its 3'utr.
20007690_1	overexpression of mir-15b, -16, -195, and -424 suppressed the activity of a luciferase reporter construct fused with the 3'-untranslated region of arl2.

26253191_1	as klf6 has been shown to induce tgf-beta during rsv infection and tgf-beta has been shown to suppress mir-24 expression, the effect of klf6 gene silencing on mir-24 expression was examined.
26253191_2	mir-24 expression was considerably upregulated, supporting the hypothesis that ns1-induced tgf-beta suppresses mir-24 expression and removing klf6, the positive inducer of tgf-beta, relieves tgf-beta-mediated mir-24 suppression.

23595747_2	verexpression of the mir17-92 cluster also altered protein levels of pten, pmtor and pgsk-3-beta in the cell body fraction .
22326957_1	this finding suggests that cyclin d1 expression and g1 phase transition of hepatocytes the conservation of rhob targeting by mir-21 is further supported by a recent study showing that mir-21 promotes the defining features of the metastatic phenotype, migration, elongation, and invasion, by inhibiting the human gene in a breast cancer cell line .
22326957_2	viewed together, our findings suggest that rhob is directly suppressed by the surge in mir-21 expression occurring in the early phase of liver regeneration.
22326957_3	we found that mir-21 knockdown impaired g1 phase exit and s phase entry, and that additional rhob knockdown restored normal cell cycle progression, which confirms rhob as the critical target of mir-21 in promotion of g1 phase progression.
22326957_4	viewed together, our results exclude suppression of pten by mir-21 as the reason for akt1 and mtorc1 activation in liver regeneration and confirm our hypothesis that mir-21 facilitates rapid translation of cyclin d1 by relieving akt1 and its mediator, mtorc1, from inhibition by rhob .
25130806_1	over-expressed mir-17 and mir-20a promote cell growth and cell cycle progression, and inhibit apoptosis through negatively-regulating p21 and e2f1 after-transcriptionally.

22935141_3	more importantly, we demonstrate that igf-ir and irs1, often overexpressed in bc, are two novel target of mir-148a 152.
22935141_4	our results suggest a novel mir-148a 152-dnmt1 regulatory circuit and reveal that mir-148a and mir-152 act as tumor suppressors by targeting igf-ir and irs1, and that restoration of mir-148a 152 expression may provide a strategy for therapeutic application to treat bc patients.
22935141_5	meanwhile, the levels of dnmt1, a direct target of mir-148a and mir-152, were inhibited by mir-148a and mir-152 overexpression.
22935141_6	the dnmt1 and mir-148a 152 form a negative feedback loop that is disrupted in bc cells.

21304604_2	we also performed quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis of sox2 mrna expression, and found that exogenous mir-126 modestly but significantly suppressed the sox2 mrna level in hsc43 cells .
21304604_3	interestingly, exogenous mir-126 transfection dose-dependently decreased the sox2 protein level in the mouse es cells , suggesting that mir-126 represses sox2 expression in various species and cell lineages.

25872451_1	smad7 and hoxd10 were downregulated in both sw480 and ht29 cells by mir-1269a .
25872451_2	western blot confirmed that mir-1269a suppresses smad 7 and hoxd10 protein levels .
25872451_3	therefore, mir-1269a directly targets smad7 and hoxd10 through the identified binding sites in their 3'utr.
21423181_1	this coincided with sequestration of mir-21 in a slower-migrating heteroduplex with antimir-21, de-repression of hela mrnas with canonical mir-21 seed match sites and upregulation of the pdcd4 target protein31 .
25982393_1	more recently, we have reported that microrna-296-5p was identified to play a tumor suppressive role by targeting the 3'utr of pin1 mrna of prostate cancer . in addition, mir-296-5p was recently found to be progres sively lost during tumor progression in various cancers, including crc .
25982393_2	to understand the correlation between mir-296-5p and pin1 in crc, we first analyzed the expression levels of pin1 protein and mir-296-5p in crc cell lines by western blot and quantitative rt-pcr analysis.
25982393_5	these results are consistent with our previous study showing that mir-296-5p playing a tumor-suppressive role by targeting pin1.
26758433_1	the correlation between mir-143 and fam83f expressions was further examined by evaluating fam83f expression in the human escc cell lines after the overexpression and knockdown of mir-143.
26758433_2	this finding suggests that the putative mirna binding sites of fam83f were responsible for this mirna-mrna interaction.
26758433_3	these results demonstrated that mir-143 regulates fam83f expression by decreasing the stability of mrna.
22474262_1	spot42, ryhb, and rybb regulate sdhc expressionpost-transcriptionally.
25135862_3	we found that protein levels of smarca4 and mst1 decreased significantly in cells transfected with mir-199a-5p mimic compared to cells transfected with scramble .
25135862_4	western blot showed that mst1 levels are positively correlated with the increasing concentration of mir-199a-5p inhibitor, further indicating that mst1 is a target of mir-199a-5p.
25135862_5	our western blots and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that smarca4 and mst1 are directly regulated by mir-199a-5p at the posttranscriptional level.
15466019_1	micc could potentially form base pairs with the ompc mrna, suggesting that it may act as an antisense regulator.
15466019_2	since the micc and ompc genes are located at different genetic loci and are produced from two separate transcriptional units,the situation strongly mimics the micf regulation of ompf.
15466019_4	these similarities encouraged us to test the hypothesis that micc regulates ompc expression.
22048026_1	among many mirnas that are predicted to target htt, we showed using various experimental approaches that mir-214, mir-150, mir-146a and mir-125b could target both human htt and mouse htt.
22048026_6	taking together, we showed that mir-214, mir-150, mir-146a and mir-125b targeted htt.
26797246_1	to investigate if crtc1 is a target of mir-212 mir-132 in insulin-secreting cells we overexpressed the micrornas and measured the expression of crtc1.

26380016_2	mir-23 regulates epc function via targeting vegf.
26380016_3	generally speaking, our research disclosed mir-23 suppresses epc activities in cad patients via targeting vegf.
25281924_5	using a bioinformatics method, we further show that cdk9 is a direct target of mir-874 and that its protein level is negatively regulated by mir-874.
25281924_6	therefore, the data reported in this manuscript demonstrate that mir-874 is an important regulator in breast cancer and imply that the mir-874 cdk9 axis has potential as a therapeutic target for breast cancer.
22846677_1	because premir-203 reduced plaa expression during sp exposure, these data confirm the interaction between mir-203 and plaa mrna.
22846677_2	mir-203 may regulate expression of the novel nociceptive mediator plaa after incision.
22846677_3	expression of plaa after sp exposure in rek cell line identifying plaa as a direct target of mir-203.
22327366_1	mock- or klf2-transduced huvecs were co-cultured with untreated smcs for 24 h and the expression levels of elk1 , klf4 and camk2d , cfl1, phactr4 and ssh2 and mmp3 were analysed by real-time pcr .
22327366_2	mouse endothelial cells were isolated from wild-type or mir-143 145-deficient mice and were incubated with smcs.
22108519_1	mature mir-143 and mir-145 are coordinately expressed, and both directly targetthe pai-1 3'utr, leading to reduced pai-1 mrna and protein levels.
22108519_2	thus, the direct comparison of mirna and mrna levels in tissue samples, and to some degree in cell lines, confirm that expression of pai-1 and mir-143/-145 are mutually exclusive.
22108519_3	however, downregulation of pai-1 expression by mir-143 and -145 was also confirmed in other cancer cell lines, including h1299 , hela and u251 , thereby demonstrating that mir-143/-145-directed repression of pai-1 is not restricted to bladder cancer .
22108519_4	plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mrna was significantly enriched upon mir-143 and -145 transfection compared with negative controls, suggesting direct interaction between mir-143/-145, risc complexes and pai-1 mrna .
20427544_1	therefore, mir-155 target smad1 and smad5 through binding to their respective predicted mir-155 target sites in their 3'-utrs.
20427544_2	to determine whether endogenous smad1, smad5, hivep2, cebpb, or myo10 genes are regulated by mir-155, quantitative rt-pcr analysis was carried out in retrovirally transduced mutu i cells.
20427544_3	expression levels of smad1, smad5, hivep2, cebpb, and myo10 were found to be lower in cells transduced with the mir-155 retrovirus .

19578724_1	in this study, we confirmed that bone morphogenetic protein receptor ii is a direct target of mir-21, and also showed that the protein level of bmprii correlates inversely with the amount of mir-21 in pc3 and lncap cells.
19578724_2	these data suggest that mir-21 could regulate the expression of bmprii by binding to not only the two downstream conserved binding sites but also the two upstream predicted binding sites.
19578724_3	taken together, these results confirmed that bmprii is regulated by mir-21.
26595523_1	further studies identify metadherin as a direct target gene of mir-630.
26595523_2	herein, we report that mir-630 is significantly suppressed in human breast cancer specimens and cancer cell lines, and the mirna suppresses breast cancer progression by targeting metadherin .
26595523_3	overall, these results suggested mtdh was the potential functional target gene of mir-630.
21656380_1	our findings showed that, when either of two binding sites in the 3'utr of the e2f1 gene was mutated, the regulation of e2f1 by mir-106a was completely eliminated.
21656380_2	taken together, these data confirmed that e2f1 is a direct target of mir-106a.
21656380_3	our results showed e2f1 induction can rescue the tumorsuppressive effects of mir-106a overexpression , indicating that e2f1 is a functional target of mir-106a.
21656380_4	therefore, the tumor-suppressive effects of mir-106a are regulated through the regulation of e2f1.
21656380_5	these indicated that mir-106a controls e2f1 levels by translational suppression rather than by mrna degradation.
21656380_6	therefore, it supported our hypothesis that mir-106a regulates p53 expression via the inhibition of e2f1.
21355095_1	kip1 ubiquitination-promoting complex 1, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, and cd115 were functional target of mir-155.
21355095_2	consistent with this, silencing of mir-155 in mdcs resulted in increased socs-1 expression at protein level , whereas forced expression of mir-155 led to reduced socs-1 expression in imdcs . in addition, kpc1 expression was reduced along with mir-155 up-regulation during dc maturation .
21355095_3	taken together, these results demonstrate that mir-155 indirectly regulates p27kip1 expression by targeting kpc1.
21355095_4	these results suggest that cd115 is a direct target of mir-155.
25817558_1	while mir-221 was identified as a suppressor of hdac6 by ectopic expression of mirna mimics in dicer knockdown cells, targeted-disruption of mir-221 repressed cancer cell growth through derepressing hdac6 expression.
25817558_2	from the comprehensive mirna expression analysis of hcc tissues paired with adjacent non-cancerous hepatic tissues, mir-221 was identified to repress endogenous hdac6 expression in hcc cells.
25817558_3	taken together, the results show that jnk stimulated by hgf led to c-jun activation and the transcriptional activation of mir-221, which elevated mir-221 expression playing a critical role in suppressing hdac6 in hcc cells.
26062664_1	snai1 is identified as a functional target of mir-153 and is downregulated in pdac specimens.
26062664_2	to further demonstrate that snai1 was directly targeted by mir-153 in pdac cells.
26062664_3	thus, our data strongly suggested that snai1 is a target of mir-153 in pdac.
21880154_1	remarkably, we found that the tumor suppressor bak1 had the most reduced activity, which suggested that bak1 was likely to be an important target regulated by mir-125b in leukemia.
21880154_2	this finding demonstrates that bak1 is a target of mir-125b in leukemic cells and that the putative mir-125b binding site is critical for mir-125b regulation of bak1 expression.
21880154_3	these results strongly suggest that bak1 is a target of mir-125b in pediatric apl.
21880154_4	furthermore, we inferred that mir-125b directly regulates bak1 expression, thereby modulating the susceptibility of leukemic cells to apoptosis.
22684007_2	these findings suggest that down-regulation of mir-376a may contribute to the development of hcc by targeting p85alpha.
22684007_4	as shown in fig.3e, the mir-376a mimics repressed the luciferase activity of the wild type plasmid but not the mutant plasmid , indicating that pik3r1 is a direct target of mir-376a.
22684007_5	taken together, these observations suggested that decreased expression of mir-376a triggered up-regulation of pik3r1 partially in hcc.
20683643_1	in hela cells, mir-200b directly reduced the expression of rnd3 at the mrna and protein levels, which thereby promoted expression of the downstream protein cyclin d1 and increased s-phase entry.
20683643_2	luciferase assays revealed that overexpression of mir-200b could significantly reduce luciferase activity from the reporter vector containing the 3'utr of rnd3.
20683643_3	our results suggest that mir-200b regulates rnd3 expression by targeting both putative targetsites 1 and 2 .
20683643_4	we conclude that mir 200b can directly regulate the expression of rnd3 in vivo .
20683643_5	our results suggest that mir-200b regulates ccnd1 expression and promotes cell cycle progression by targeting rnd3 .

25355277_1	pre-treatment with isdn reversed the decrease in mir-130b expression induced by hg stimulation , but had no apparent effect on mir-130a expression .
25355277_2	furthermore, inhibition of the erk foxm1 pathway by either pd98059 or foxm1 sirna substantially abolished the recovery of mir-130b expression following pre-treatment with isdn.
25355277_3	erk phosphorylation and foxm1 activity were examined following the downregulation of mir-130b, indicating that there were no signficant changes between the control group and the antagomir group, both in phosphorylated erk and in foxm1 expression.mirna-130b
22899845_1	here, we have identified a novel heart-andmuscle-specific microrna, mir-92b, which is activated by mef2 and subsequently downregulates mef2 through binding to its 3'utr, forming a negative regulatory circuit that fine-tunes the level of mef2.
22899845_2	mir-92b negatively regulates mef2 levels in vivo.
22899845_3	mir-92b negatively regulates mef2 through binding to conserved mir-92b targeting sites on mef2 3'utr.
22899845_4	mutation of the mir-92b targeting sites in the mef2 3'utr largely abolished this inhibition , suggesting that mir-92b inhibits mef2 expression through binding to the two conserved mir-92b targeting sites.
22899845_5	these results indicate that the mir-92b sponge could efficiently compete with the endogenous mir-92b targeting sites, including the ones in mef2 3'utr, and subsequently release the inhibition of mef2 expression caused by mir-92b.
22899845_6	these rescue experiments suggest that one essential role of mir-92b is to regulate mef2 levels.
22194984_2	luciferase assays and western blot analysis demonstrated that the mir-200b 200c 429 family recognized the mre in the 3'utr of ap-2alpha gene and negatively regulated the expression of endogenous ap-2alpha proteins.
26687115_1	amongst these, fzd3, fzd5, dvl3, frat2, and ck2a2 were validated as direct targets of the mir-29 family.
26651881_1	we also discovered that the effects of mir-21 on hasm cells depended on pten expression.
26651881_2	overexpression of mir-21 is directly related to the decrease of pten expression in hasm cells.
26651881_3	mir-21 significantly downregulated the expression of pten in the hasm cells and the low expression of pten depended on the level of mir-21.
25094038_1	mir-106b reduces tgf--beta type ii receptor expression during emt.
25094038_3	4c and d, tgf--beta1 induced expression of tgf--beta type ii receptorin hk-2 cells undergoing emt, whereas enhancement of mir-106b expression inhibited the expression of tgf--beta type ii receptor .
25094038_4	these data suggest that the inhibitory effects of the mir-106b-25 cluster in tgf--beta1-induced emt of hk-2 cells may be due to the reduced activity of tgf--beta signaling and the associated decrease in expression of tgf--beta type ii receptor.
22450326_1	we further identified that mir-25 directly targeted cdh1 3'-untranslated region and repressed the expression of cdh1.
22450326_2	these results, for the first time, demonstrate that mir-25 promotes escc cell migration and invasion by suppressing cdh1 expression. in addition, we uncovered an inverse correlation between mir-25 and cdh1 in escc cell lines.
22450326_3	furthermore, cdh1 reversing cell migration and invasion induced by mir-25 overexpression indicated that cdh1 functioned as a mediator of mir-25 in cell migration and invasion.
22450326_4	our study indicates that mir-25 inhibits the translation of cdh1 mrna by targeting its 3'utr, which adds a new explanation of deregulation of cdh1 expression in escc.
22508046_3	the expression pattern was inversed with mir-206, indicating that mir-206 might regulate otx2 expression in vivo.
25844955_1	in addition, ch3, but not ch1 and ch2, significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha-搒timulated expression of the mir-126 target vcam-1 to a similar extent as mir-126-3p mimic transfection .

26531758_2	figure 2. mir-21 regulates the smad7 protein level by inhibiting translation.
26531758_3	thus, smad7 is a functional target of mir-21 whose upregulation promotes egf -induced breast cancer cell invasion and migration.
20859956_1	furthermore, we detected the downregulation of the protein level of cyclin g1 with mir-122a overexpression .

25731730_2	these results further suggested that timp2 is a direct target of mir-221 222 and that mir-221 222 promote glioma cell invasion and angiogenesis, at least in part by inhibiting timp3 expression.
21752897_1	interestingly, a significant decrease in cxcr4 mrna level was observed in the cells transfected with the mir-1 with respect to the scrambled oligonucleotide , whereas sdf-1alpha mrna expression levels are unchanged , indicating that mir-1 affects cxcr4 protein synthesis by facilitating the specific degradation of cxcr4 mrna.
21752897_2	we also show that mir-1 transfection down-regulates the luciferase activity of a reporter construct carrying the 3'utr-cxcr4 or 3'utr-sdf-1alpha sequence , and the mutation in the putative 3'utr site inhibits the sensitivity of the reporter constructs to mir-1.

24384130_1	furthermore, by using luciferase assays, we found that both overexpression and inhibition of mir-125b induced a significant change of vegf-a luciferase activity , which demonstrated that vegf-a is also a direct target of mir-125b in biliary epithelial cells.
24384130_2	we found that, after knockdown of mir-125b, there is an increase in hdc expression compared with control-transfected cells .
22363487_2	4, the mir-34a precursor dramatically decreased the expression of notch1 and jagged1 protein and mrna, while there were no effects of mir-34a on notch2 protein and mrna levels.
22363487_3	the protein levels of notch1 and jagged1 were suppressed more than the mrna levels by mir-34a transfection, implying that mr-34a regulated the expression of notch1 and jagged1 at the post-transcriptional level.
22363487_4	the results showed that snail protein expression was suppressed by mir-34a transfection.
22363487_5	these data indicate that mir-34a directly interacts with the 3'utr of notch1 and jagged1, but not with notch2.
26141986_1	met was found to be a target for mir-449c .
26141986_3	the intact 3'utr of met was cloned into luciferase reporter plasmids, which were used for co-transfection with mir-449c or as-mir-449c into snu~ 5 cells.
26141986_4	we found that mir-449c significantly reduced the luciferase activity of the 3'utr reporter for met, while as-mir-449c significantly increased the luciferase activity of the 3'utr reporter for met. the mir-449c-mediated changes in met transcript levels were further found to alter protein levels .
26141986_5	thus, our data suggest that mir-449c may function at least partially via met.
26617770_1	luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that mir-133b could directly target egfr.
26617770_2	altogether, our results indicated that mir-133b overexpression was shown to inhibit proliferation and invasion of oc cells through suppression of the mapk and pi3k akt signaling pathways by targeting egfr.
25073510_2	mir-144 acts as a tumor suppressor in some malignancies, while its role in hcc is unclear.
25073510_5	e2f transcription factor 3 was identified as a target of mir-144 in hcc cells.
25073510_6	moreover, e2f3 overexpression partially attenuated the tumor suppressive effects of mir-144, and the expression of e2f3 was negatively correlated with mir-144 level in hcc tissues.
25073510_7	our data suggest that mir-144 might suppress the growth and motility of hcc cells partially by targeting e2f3.
21339227_1	mir-124a directly binds to the 3'-untranslated region of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mrna, and the induction of mir-124a in ra synoviocytes significantly suppressed the production of the cdk-2 and mcp-1 proteins.
21339227_2	subsequent luciferase assays showed that mir-124a specifically suppressed the luciferase activity driven by the 3'utr of mcp-1 mrna.
21339227_3	a luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that mir-124a specifically suppressed the reporter activity driven by the 3'utr of cdk-2 mrna but not reporters driven by the mutant of 3'utr of cdk-2 mrna.
21339227_4	we also found that cdk-6 protein, another cdk that regulates the g1-s phase, was suppressed by mir-124a.
23087182_1	our data point toward an important role for mir-20a in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines release, by controlling ask1 expression in ra fls.
23087182_2	altogether, these data suggest that ask1 mrna is a conserved direct target for post-transcriptional regulation by mir-20a.
23087182_3	these results indicate that mir-20a regulates the expression of ask1 at the translational level.
26461474_1	this suggests that kdm2a, kdm4a, kdm5b, kdm7a and med1 are direct targets of mir137.
19318487_4	microarray and bioinformatic analysis identified the novel oncogene macrophage migration inhibitory factor as a potential target of mir-451. in fact, overexpression of mir-451 down-regulated mrna and protein levels of mif and decreased expression of reporter genes with mif target sequences.
19318487_5	moreover, we found a significant inverse correlation between mir-451 and mif expression in tumoral gastric biopsies.
22185353_1	accordingly, over-expression of mir-16 could significantly suppress the luciferase activity of reporter fusion with the binding sites of tnfalpha in its 3'utr region, suggesting that mir-16 played its role in lps-induced lung inflammation by a direct manner.
22185353_2	it has been previously reported that mirna regulates the expression of the targetmrnas by binding its 3'utr , thus, the 3'utr of either il-6 or tnfalpha was cloned into psicheck2 vector, and the results showed that over-expression of mir-16 could significantly suppress the luciferase activity of reporter fusion with the binding sites of tnfalpha in its 3'utr region, but that it could not suppress that of il-6 , suggesting a direct action of mir-16 in lps-induced lung inflammation.
23780685_1	luciferase activity assay showed that mir-181a mimics inhibited bcrp expression by targeting the 3' untranslated region of the bcrp mrna.
23780685_2	these findings suggest that mir-181a regulates bcrp expression via binding to the 3' -utr of bcrp mrna.
23780685_3	importantly, our study revealed that mir-181a, functioning as a bcrp suppressor, reversed bcrp-mediated drug resistance in vitro and in vivo.
23780685_4	compared with the negative control, mir-181a mimics significantly inhibited luciferase activity in mcf-7 mx cells , suggesting that the 3' -utr of the bcrp mrna is a target site of mir-181a.
23780685_5	the expression of bcrp, but not mrp, pgp, and lrp was significantly decreased in cells transfected with mir-181a mimics,comparedto cells transfected with negative controls.
23780685_6	, suggesting that mir-181a negatively regulated endogenous bcrp expression.
22301781_1	to further confirm the specificity of 3'utr sequences targeted by mir-16 and mir-195, luciferase reporter constructs containing mutant 3'utr were constructed .
22301781_2	luciferase reporter gene activity of these mutants was not affected by overexpression of mir-16 or mir-195 .
22301781_3	these data indicate that mir-16 and mir-195 directly associated with the 3'utr of mapk8, ccne1, andcdc6 to repress their protein expression.
22301781_4	we observed that suppression of mir-16 and mir-195 clearly increased expression of mapk8, ccne1, and cdc6 , although its effect on brdu incorporation was not clear .
22301781_5	further studies are needed to demonstrate whether or not mapk8, ccne1, and cdc6 are sufficient targets of mir-16 and mir-195 to induce cell proliferation by mediating tsh action.
21548929_1	collectively, our results demonstrate that mir-196a is a bona fide negative regulator of nobox during bovine early embryogenesis.
21548929_2	figure 1 prediction of a mir-196a binding site in the 3'utr of bovine nobox mrna.
21548929_3	thus, the inverse relationship between mir-196a and nobox expression activity supports the proposed role of mir-196a as a physiological regulator of nobox during early embryogenesis.
21548929_4	these results unequivocally show that bovine nobox is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by mir-196a and further supports the hypothesis that mir-196a is responsible for the negative regulation of nobox.
21548929_5	these data indicate the predicted mre is critical for the direct and specific binding of mir-196a to nobox transcript.

17660297_2	to test whether let-7i can induce cleavage of tlr4 mrna, we measured the mrna level of tlr4 in cultured cholangiocytes transfected with either let-7i antisense 2-methoxy oligonucleotide or let-7i precursor by quantitative rt-pcr.

26428001_2	competition assays showed a sequence-specific interaction between hsa-mir-29a-3p and its cognate mrna targets in the abcc6, aldh5a1, and slc22a7 genes, since the decreases of mirna-mrna complexes occurred when excess unlabeled hsa-mir-29a-3p oligonucleotides were added to the reactions.
26428001_3	the hsa-mir-29a-3p mimic did not suppress luciferase activities for the mutated-aldh5a1 or mutated-slc22a7 constructs, indicating that hsa-mir-29a-3p targets the 3'-utrs of aldh5a1 and slc22a7 mrna in a sequence-specific manner.

22498306_2	the luciferase activity of the report gene with cd44 3'utr was significantly inhibited by mir-199a, whereas the luciferase activity of the report gene with the mutated cd44 3'utr was not affected by mir-199a .
22498306_3	these results demonstrated that mir-199a can target cd44 mrna by specifically binding to the cd44 3'utr.
22498306_4	these data indicated that exogenous mir-199a downregulated the expression of endogenous cd44 in cd44+/cd117+ ovarian cics.

21113131_3	neither nkrf expression level nor nf-kappab reporter activity was affected by mir-130a, indicating that the complementation of 3- part of mir-301a to 3'utr of nkrf is essential for nkrf-negative regulation.
21113131_4	thus, we conclude that the interaction of mir-301a and nkrf represents a 3- compensatory site and the first one with two g:u pairs.
21113131_5	these results indicate that overexpression of mir-301a down-regulates nkrf protein levels and that down-regulation of nkrf by mir-301a is dependent on the nkrf 3'utr.
21113131_6	this result indicated that mir-301a may targetother genes beyond nkrf to regulate nf-kappab activation.
23280823_1	taken together, our findings suggest that ebv encoded mir-bart3 mirna targets dice1 tumor suppressor to promote cellular growth and transformation in npc.enforced expression of mir-bart3 or its precursor pre-mir-bart3 led to down-regulation of endogenous dice1 expression.

19015276_1	these abnormalities can be attributed, at least in part, to elevated expression of srf and cyclin d2, which are target for repression by mir-133a.
19015276_2	the regulation of mir-133 by srf and the targeting of srf by mir-133 provide a negative feedback loop to precisely titrate the actions of srf such that elevations of srf activity enhance the expression of mir-133a with consequent dampening of srf expression.
17998940_1	microrna-218 was specifically underexpressed in hpv-positive cell lines, cervical lesions and cancer tissues containing hpv-16 dna compared to both c-33a and the normal cervix.expression of the e6 oncogene of high-risk hpv-16, but not that of low-risk hpv-6, reduced mir-218 expression, and conversely, rna interference of e6 e7 oncogenes in an hpv-16-positive cell line increased mir-218 expression.

21983127_4	altogether, our data suggest that mir-150 represses her2 and its downstream signaling through muc4 downregulation in pc cells.
21983127_5	our findings, thus suggest that mir-150-mediated inhibition of growth and clonogenicity in pc cells may, in part, be due to downregulation of muc4 expression.
21983127_6	our study confirms the clinical relevance of our experimental data on mir-150-mediated muc4 regulation in pc cells.
21983127_7	furthermore, our results provide an evidence for a clinical correlation of mir-150 and muc4 expression in a small subset of malignant pancreatic tissues, whereas muc4 in normal pancreas primarily seemed to be regulated by transcriptional mechanisms.

22834685_4	low expression of both lrrc4 and mir185 was significantly associated with a shorter overall survival .
22834685_5	together, these data indicate that lrrc4 can inhibit glioma cell invasion by increasing mir-185 expression, and that mir-185 targets cdc42 and rhoa directly as well as vegfa, vimentin, and gfap indirectly both in vivo and in vitro.

26253106_1	here, we mainly focused on mir-181a to further investigate the interaction between meg3 and mir-181a in gc cells.
26253106_2	these data demonstrated that mir-181a could bind to meg3 and meg3 could function as a cerna in gc cells.
26253106_3	to validate whether mir-181a targets bcl-2 in gc, immunoblotting assay was carried out and showed that bcl-2 was about 2-fold higher in hgc-27 cells transfected with mir-181a inhibitor compared with the control .
26253106_4	because meg3 shared regulatory mir-181a with bcl-2 mrna, we wondered whether meg3 could modulate bcl-2 in gc cells.
26253106_5	all these results suggest an important role of meg3 in modulating bcl-2 by competitively binding mir-181a.

21242962_1	upa is the targetgene for mir-23b as the mir repressed upa expression and interacted with the 3'-untranslated region of upa mrna.
21242962_2	by western blot analysis, ectopic mir-23b expression resulted in a reduction and mir-23b inhibition led to an elevation of upa protein level in siha cells .
21242962_3	this confirms the targeting effect of mir-23b on upa mrna. it also verifies that the influence of mir-23b on cell migration in human cervical carcinoma cells is through upa. the results suggest the role of p53 in the regulation of mir-23b upa in siha cells.

10903453_3	c6uas has no apparent orf and most likely represents a structural rna gene that is transcribed but not translated.
10903453_4	this feature and the antisense polarity of transcription suggest that c6uas could play a regulatory role on the expression of c6orf4, as indicated by a significant decrease of endogenous c6orf4 expression after transfection of c6uas cdna in human fibroblasts.
10903453_5	neither c6uas nor c6orf4-6 genes show any homology with known human genes.

20574151_3	these data elucidate that mir-520b and mir-520e can directly targetthe cd46 gene by binding to the 3'utr, which further supports that mir-520b is able to downregulate the expression of cd46 at post-transcriptional level.
17914404_1	several recent studies have found a conserved microrna family, the mir-34s, to be direct transcriptional target of p53.

22330340_2	significant repression of luciferase activity was observed after co-transfection of pax3-3'utr with mir-1 and or -206 precursors compared with scrambled controls, which suggests that mir-1 and -206 can targetpax3.
22330340_3	figure 3 mir-1 and -206 regulates pax3 expression through sequence-specific binding to its 3'utr.
22330340_4	these results indicate that both binding sites of mir-1 and -206 in pax3 are functional and there is minimal preference between these binding sites.
22330340_5	these data also suggests that there was no preferential selection between mir-1 and -206 to regulate pax3 at least under the current experimental conditions.
21518763_1	the negative regulation of mir-365 was strictly dependent on a microrna binding element in the 3'utr of il-6 mrna.
21518763_3	1a, only transfection with mir-365 expression vector significantly down-regulated luciferase activity compared with transfection with an empty vector, indicating that mir-365 is a potential regulator of il-6.
21518763_4	thus, it can be concluded that mir-365 decreases il-6 expression by repressing its mrna translation but does not affect its mrna stability.
21518763_5	these results provided experimental support to the prediction that the mir-365 response element is located in the 3'utr of il-6.
19615744_1	the mrna expression of transcription factor myb, the designated target of mir-150, was shown to correlate inversely with the mir-150 level.

20162574_1	bcl2 is a targetgene of the mature mir-181s.
20162574_2	the luciferase activity of a bcl2 3'-untranslated region-based reporter construct in sgc7901 vcr and a549 cddp cells suggests that a new targetsite in the 3'utr of bcl2 of the mature mir-181s was found. in sgc7901 vcr and a549 cddp cells, a significant decrease in relative luciferase activity was noted when pgl3-bcl2-3'utr was cotransfected with the mature mir-181s mimic but not with the control mirna mimic, respectively , which suggests that the position 2888-2894 of bcl2 3'utr is also a targetsite by the mature mir-181s.
20162574_3	as bcl2 is an antiapoptotic protein and a target of the mature mir-181s, we hypothesized that the mir-181b might modulate mdr of cancer cells by repressing the bcl2 protein expression.

21763238_2	the deletion of the mir-122a binding sequence on 3'utr prevented the pre-mir-122a inhibition of luciferase activity , suggesting that mir-122a inhibits the luciferase activity by binding to its complementary sequence on 3'utr.
21763238_3	these results indicated that the increase in mir-122a expression was required for the tnf-alpha induced degradation of occludin mrna and increase in caco-2 tj permeability.

26315535_2	this prediction was functionally validated by over-expressing mir-9-5p in pulmonary fibroblasts , which resulted in a decrease of tgfbr2 mrna and protein levels and also reduced the mrna and protein expression of nox4 after induction by tgf-b1 .
26315535_3	the data are consistent with a direct regulation of tgfbr2 and nox4 by mir-9-5p.
25231457_1	previously, it has been shown that stat5 is a direct activator of mir-182 which is in turn a robust inhibitor of foxo1.
25231457_3	thus, under oxidative stress and mir-182 down-regulation, foxo1 has the opportunity to be translated leading to foxo1 over-expression.
25231457_4	finally, pro-apoptotic gene targets of foxo1 e.g., bim and bax are up-regulated leading to apoptosis.
24728149_1	mir-34a plays a role in regulation of ang ii-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by inhibition of atg9a expression and autophagic activity.
20406979_1	knockdown of p21 in mll-transformed cells phenocopied the overexpression of the mir-17 polycistron, including a significant decrease in leukemia latency,validating p21 as a biologically relevant and direct in vivo target of the mir-17 polycistron in mll leukemia.
20406979_2	because the seed regions of mir-17-5p and mir-20a share perfect complementarities with the 3'utr of p21 mrna , this suggested that these micrornas may directly regulate p21 to modulate cell cycle progression in mll leukemia cells.
20406979_3	thus, p21 is a critical in vivo and direct target of the mir-17 polycistron in mediating mll leukemias.
24885920_2	ectopic expression of mir-139-5p in colon cancer cell lines significantly suppressed cell growth as evidenced by cell viability assay and colony formation assay and in xenograft tumor growth in nude mice .
24885920_3	mir-139-5p induced apoptosis , concomitantly with up-regulation of key apoptosis genes including cleaved caspase-8, caspase-3, caspase-7 and parp.
26824500_1	previous report indicated that the plk1 was a target of mir-100 .
26824500_2	immunoblot analysis showed that the expression level of plk1 was indeed up-regulated and down-regulated in huh7 cells upon silencing and overexpressing mir-100.
26824500_3	this result indicated that the physical interaction between prec-pol and mir-100 resulted in an inhibitory effect on the mir-100 function, leading to plk1 up-regulation.
26824500_5	furthermore, among the 115 patients, pearson's correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between mir-100 and plk1.
24686458_1	here, we report that microrna 376a regulates primordial follicle assembly by modulating the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen , a gene we previously reported to regulate primordial follicle assembly by regulating oocyte apoptosis in mouse ovaries.
24686458_2	mir-376a was shown to be negatively correlated with pcna mrna expression in fetal and neonatal mouse ovaries and to directly bind to pcna mrna 3' untranslated region.
26819305_3	fig 3 eef1a1 is a target of mir-33a-5p.
26819305_5	8, cotransfection of mir-33a-5p mimics and vector markedly reduced jev replication, whereas cotransfection of mir-33a-5p mimics and myc-tagged eef1a1 plasmid countervailed the inhibition, indicating that mir-33a-5p negatively regulates jev replication by targeting eef1a1.
21880628_1	a significant reduction was also apparent for the newly identified mirna-target gene pairs clcn3-mir-15a, crkl-mir-15a, irf2-mir-20a, kit-mir-19a and -mir-20a, mn1-mir-15a as well as serpinb9-mir-29a .
26429314_1	forcing mir-29a caused a downregulation of the cytotoxicity determinant nk activating receptor via upregulation of mir-155.
26429314_2	using luciferase reporter assay, it was proven that mir-155 binds to the 3'utr of nkg2d mrna and hence alters its expression .
26429314_3	this study concludes that mir-29a alters the expression of the transcription factor pu.1, which in turn manipulates the expression of mir-155 and its downstream target activating receptor nkg2d as well as the cytolytic effector prf-1 and hence causes a reduction in cytolytic effect of nk cells on hcv infected cell models .
26232986_1	in addition, protein kinase c alpha was also identified as a direct target of mir-150-5p by establishing a mirna-mrna network, and this target was validated via dual-luciferase reporter and western blot analysis.
26232986_2	taken together, these results supported that prkca is a direct target gene of mir-150-5p.
26238950_2	the above data identified that stat3 is a direct target gene of mir-519d.
26238950_3	this study also shows that mir-519d plays an important role in the regulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion by downregulating stat3.
22764048_1	we further demonstrate that pax6 is an important target of mir-7. in this study, we characterized mir-7 expression and identified its functions in endocrine cell differentiation.
22764048_2	we show that mir-7 directly represses pax6 mrna expression and fine-tunes its levels.
22764048_3	pax6 is a mir-7 target taken together, these results indicate that pax6 is a bona fide target of mir-7 in -beta-cells.
22764048_5	accordingly, mir-7 kd resulted in reduced numbers of ghrelin-positive cells , supporting the view that mir-7 knockdown acts upstream of pax6 to promote differentiation into insulin- and glucagon-positive cells at the expense of ghrelin-positive cells.
22764048_6	thus, gain-of-function analysis substantiates our conclusions that mir-7 regulates pax6 and downstream endocrine genes, including insulin and ghrelin.
22764048_7	therefore, when mir-7 was overexpressed in pdx1-cre;rosa26-mir-7 embryos, pax6 levels decreased and the expression of insulin and glucagon was downregulated, providing in vivo evidence for control of pax6 by mir-7.
26240284_1	in hdac10 knockdown cells, let-7f and microrna 98 were upregulated and the let-7 family target, hmga2, was downregulated.
26240284_2	many let-7 family members were highly expressed in hdac10 knockdown cells and reduced in cells overexpressing hdac10 .
26240284_3	using the same reporter system, hdac10 only regulated the wt hmga2 3'utr, but not the mutant , which indicated that the effect of hdac10 on the hmga2 3'utr required some or all of the seven conserved let-7 sites.
26240284_4	we concluded that hdac10 regulates the hmga2 3'utr through let-7 family members.
22395361_1	mir-30a is a potent inhibitor of autophagy by downregulating beclin 1 and atg5 expression.
22018986_1	we then performed a luciferase reporter assay to verify that let-7a directly target nirf.
22018986_2	these results suggest that the 3'utr of the nirf gene contained regulatory elements by which let-7a regulates nirf expression.
22018986_3	taken together, these data indicate that let-7a may regulate nirf expression through let-7a-binding sites at the 3' -utr of nirf.
22018986_4	moreover, a significant negative correlation between let-7a and nirf mrna and protein levels was revealed in both crc tissues and colon cancer cells .
22018986_5	this observation is in accordance with our previous observations that let-7a suppressed the expression of nirf. in addition, our results show that let-7a negatively regulates nirf expression and inhibits crc tumorigenesis in nude mice.
23223022_1	western blot analysis showed increases in the levels of p70s6k, eif4e, mknk1, mknk2, and mapkap1, as well as in the phosphorylation of s6 and eif4e in mir-7a-deficient mouse islets demonstrated that suppression of mir-7a activated mtor signaling in primary islets.
23568547_1	also, caspase-2 was proved to be one of direct targets of mir-708 in t24 and 5637 cells.
23568547_2	moreover, we found that caspase-2 was a direct target of mir-708.
23568547_3	these results suggested that this site in the 3'utr of caspase-2 mrna was the direct interaction site with mir-708. in bladder carcinoma cell line t24 and 5637, using luciferase assay and western blotting assay, we found a direct link between mir-708 and its putative target caspase-2, which has been extensively verified to be an apoptosis inducer.
23137536_1	mir-186, mir-216b, mir-337-3p, and mir-760 cooperatively induce cellular senescence by targeting a subunit of protein kinase ckii in human colorectal cancer cells.
23137536_2	as a result, we found that mir-186, mir-216b, mir- 337-3p, and mir-760 could target the 3'utr of ckiialpha mrna .
23137536_3	taken together, these results indicate that mir-186, mir-216b, mir-337-3p, and mir-760 jointly function to repress ckiialpha expression by reducing the stability of ckiialpha mrna through specific targeting of the 3'utr of ckiialpha mrna in hct116 cells.
23137536_4	taken together, these results suggest that mir-186, mir-216b, mir-337-3p, and mir-760 may induce senescence through ckii inhibition-mediated ros generation.
23137536_5	taken together, these results indicate that ckii inhibition-mediated senescence can be blocked by antisense inhibitors of mir-186, mir-216b, mir-337-3p, and mir-760 in hct116 cells.
23137536_6	taken together, these results strongly indicate that mir-186, mir-216b, mir-337-3p, and mir-760 jointly produce ros and induce senescence through ckiialpha downregulation.
26318398_1	fig. 4b shows the effect of mir-27a knockdown and overexpression on the levels of ldlr mrna and protein.
26318398_2	we concluded that mir-27a induced a decrease in ldlr at mrna and protein levels.
26660116_1	furthermore, overexpression of mir-9 inhibits the expression of bcl2l11 protein while inhibition of mir-9 enhances the expression of bcl2l11 proteins in primary cultures .
26660116_2	finally, as mir-9 is upregulated in mcao mice and ogd neurons, we examined the protein level of bcl2l11 in those conditions and found that bcl2l11 proteins are increased significantly in both mcao mice and ogd neurons .
26572153_2	further, we identified tumor suppressor foxo1 was a novel target of mir-411 in the lung cancer cells and knockdown of foxo1 in lung cancer cells in which mir-411 was inhibited could enhance cell proliferation, colony formation ability, and anchorage-independent growth ability.
26572153_3	taken together, our results showed that foxo1 is a bona fide target of mir-411. in this study, we used lung ac cell lines a549 and calu-3 to investigate the function of mir-411 in cell proliferation and found foxo1 was the target of mir-411.
26858310_1	this indicates that mir-182 directly targets rad51.
20871609_1	fig. 1 the p53 3'utr contains binding sites for mir-380-5p, a developmentally restricted mirna.
20871609_2	to examine the function of endogenous mir-380-5p, we utilized an lna-modified antisense oligomer to inhibit mir-380-5p .
20871609_4	uv irradiation led to a dose-dependent increase in p53 protein expression that was suppressed by the expression of mir-380-5p .
20871609_5	there was no significant difference in p53 mrna levels following mir-380-5p overexpression , suggesting a predominant role in the regulation of p53 translation rather than mrna stability.
20871609_6	together with our data from es cells , this suggests that mir-380-5p acts to directly regulate p53 translation rather than the stability of the mrna or protein.
20871609_7	thus mir-380-5p can directly attenuate translation via elements found in the p53 3'utr.
20871609_8	importantly, the mature mir-380-5p sequence and mir-380-5p target sequence in the p53 3'utr are conserved between human and mouse.
25436980_1	tcf7, a wnt signaling-related gene, has been implicated as a critical factor in bone metastasis, and here we show that tcf7 is a direct target of mir-34a.
25436980_2	our data show that the bone metastasis and anti-apoptotic effects found in ras signaling-activated prostate cancer cells require mir-34a deficiency, which in turn aids in cell survival by activating the wnt and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways thereby inducing tcf7 and birc5 expressions.
25436980_3	mir-34a directly binds to the 3'utr of tcf7 and regulates the stability of tcf7 mrna.
25436980_4	these results are consistent with our observation linking mir-34a inactivation to a significantly increased tcf7 expression, required in oncogenic wnt-activated prostate cancer.
26287415_1	moreover, we demonstrated that mir-664 downregulated plp2 expression by directly targeting the plp2 untranslated region.
26287415_2	in the present work, we observed that mir-664 suppressed cmm by directly targeting the 3'utr of plp2 rna, which consequently led to inhibition of the pi3k akt pathway and decreased proliferation.
26287415_3	therefore, our results determine that plp2 is a bona fide target of mir-664.
22735812_1	furthermore, overexpression of mir-146a suppressed tgf--beta-induced hsc proliferation, and increased hsc apoptosis.
22735812_2	bioinformatics analyses predict that smad4 is the potential target of mir-146a.
22735812_3	mir-146a overexpression in tgf--beta1-treated hsc did not decrease target mrna levels, but significantly reduced target protein expression.
22735812_4	these results suggested that mir-146a may function as a novel regulator to modulate hsc activation during tgf--beta1 induction by targeting smad4.
22610915_1	finally, adenomatous polyposis coli , which negatively regulates wnt signaling, was identified as the direct and functional target of mir-155.
22610915_3	these data suggest that mir-155 activates wnt/-beta-catenin signaling by inhibiting apc.
21903578_1	furthermore, gsk-3-beta has a conservative mir-26a seed sequence in its 3'utr .
21903578_2	however, in both experiments, there was no significant change in gsk-3-beta mrna levels, suggesting that mir-26a predominantly inhibits gsk-3-beta translation.
21903578_3	subsequently, we confirmed the effect of mir-26a on gsk-3-beta translation.
21903578_4	to determine whether mir-26a indeed binds on gsk-3-beta 3'utr, we transfected asmcsdes-/- with a reporter construct containing the luciferase gene fused to the gsk-3-beta 3'utr-beta .
21903578_7	overall, our data support a model in which loss of desmin in asmcs up-regulates mir-26a that inhibits gsk-3-beta protein expression, which in turn induces hypertrophy by increasing the expression of smooth muscle-specific markers.
21903578_8	knockdown of desmin in hasmcs also decreased gsk-3-beta protein expression, and transfection of these cells with mir-26a-antagomir increased gsk-3-beta protein expression .
22378788_1	in this study, we showed that both mir-96 and mir-375 act as direct negative regulators on the long 3'utr pgr isoform.
22378788_2	luciferaseassay, we confirmed that pgr is a primate-specific target of mir-96 and a rhesus monkey-specific target of mir-375, respectively.
22378788_3	we further demonstrated that pgr is a valid target of mir-96 in rhesus monkey and human but not in rodents, whereas the regulation of pgr by mir-375 is rhesus monkey-specific.
20624982_1	the up-regulation of map3k7 and -betatrc by knockdown of mir-10a, predicted by in silico analyses, is consistent with the activation of nf-kappab signal transduction in mir-10a knockdown haec.
20624982_2	consistent with this observation, inhibition of endogenous endothelial mir-10a led to higher regulation of -betatrc than map3k7 at the transcriptional and translational levels .
19808020_1	mir-210 recognizes iscu1 2 as direct target for repression.
19808020_4	nonetheless, through both gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays, these data demonstrate that mir-210 is necessary and sufficient for the down-regulation of iscu1 2 during hypoxia.
19808020_5	taken together with the bioinformatic predictions and the down-regulation of endogenous iscu1 2 by mir-210, these results demonstrate that mir-210 represses gene expression by recognizing the predicted targetsequence in the 3'utr of iscu1 2.
17264113_1	the porin-regulating srnas, micc and micf, form an extended though imperfect rna duplex with the 5'-utrs of the ompc and ompf mrnas, respectively, whereas mica forms an almost perfect 16 bp duplex encompassing the rbs region of ompa mrna.
25542424_2	as a direct target of microrna-193a-3p that promotes the multi-chemoresistance of the bladder cancer cell, psen1 acts as an important executor for the microrna-193a-3p's positive impact on the multi-chemoresistance of bladder cancer, probably via its activating effect on dna damage response pathway.
19177201_1	we demonstrated that agtr1, fgf7, znf537, zic3, and ikbke are true mir-155 target genes in hl. after cotransfection with anti-mir-155 oligonucleotides, significantly increased relative luciferase expression levels were obtained for agtr1, znf537 , fgf7 , zic3, maf, and ikbke, implying that these genes are true mir-155 target .
22016468_2	mir-622 functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting k-ras.
22016468_3	however, the mir-622 mimic did not affect the k-ras mrna expression levels, suggesting that mir-622 regulates k-ras mrna translation without affecting accumulation levels .
22016468_4	these results demonstrated that k-ras is a potential target of mir-622; we verified this with the luciferase reporter assay.
22016468_5	in contrast, the luciferase activity was not affected by mutant type mt-k-ras plasmid cotransfection with mir-622 mimic and mir-622 inhibitor, potentially because mir-622 was unable to recognize the complete mutant binding sites of k-ras mrna, thereby disrupting the interaction between mir-622 and k-ras .
22016468_6	these data indicate that k-ras is targeted directly by mir-622.
22016468_7	taken together, these results indicated that k-ras is a functional targetin the growth retardation induced by mir-622.
20421599_1	using this assay, we found that the 3'utr of cdh-3 can confer a significant mir-52-dependent inhibition of translation .
20421599_2	we then tested whether the mir-51 family can regulate the cdh-3 3'utr in the hypodermis, in which the mir-51 family is expressed and gfp expression can be assayed easily .
20421599_3	taken together, these data show that mir-52 directly regulates the cdh-3 3'utr in vivo.
20421599_4	we also tested if the cdh-3 3'utr is regulated by the mir-51 family in the arcade cells, where regulation of cdh-3 by mir-51 family mirnas may be required for pharyngeal attachment.
20421599_5	these data suggest that the mir-51 family directly regulates cdh-3 expression in the arcade cells.
20421599_6	these data suggest that at least one function of the mir-51 family during pharyngeal morphogenesis is to downregulate cdh-3.
23977013_1	the mir-200 family members target both zeb1 and zeb2.
23977013_2	the mir-200 family is divided into two groups according to their sequence seed: group 1 and group 2 . in isolated glomeruli, of 16-wk-old lp animals, mir-141, mir-200a, mir-200b and mir-429 were significantly down-regulated compared to np offspring .
23977013_3	the mir-200 family members target both zeb1 and zeb2 . in lp offspring, the gene expression for collagen 1alpha1, collagen 1alpha2 and zeb2 gene expression were significantly increased in isolated glomeruli .
23977013_4	surprisingly, unchanged findings for mrna expression for desmin, e-cadherin, fibronectin, tgf--beta1, zeb1 and zo-1 were found for both groups .
22009755_2	luciferase reporter assay and expression analysis showed that timp3, a tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor, is a common target of mir-221 222 and -181b.
22009755_3	these data suggest a cumulative inhibitory effect of mir-221 222 and -181 on timp3 expression in the ohtr cells. in summary, growth factor signaling is facilitated in ohtr cells due to reduced timp3 level that, in turn, is regulated by mir-221 222 and -181b in these cells.
22009755_4	these data suggest the role of mir-221 222 181b and timp3 in facilitating akt-mediated proliferation of tamoxifen-resistant cells.
21051663_2	western blot analysis showed that transfection of mir-1 significantly decreased the expression level of endogenous pim-1 protein . in addition, there was no significant decrease in the mrna level of pim-1 on mir-1 transfection, although a tendency for the decreased expression of pim-1 was observed in spindle-shaped smcs .
21051663_3	together, our results demonstrated that pim-1 is a direct regulatory target of mir-1 in smcs.
21051663_4	given that pim-1 is known to stimulate the proliferation of smcs, our results provided an explanation for mir-1-mediated smc proliferation repression.
21853268_1	microrna-132 target hb-egf in mast cells.
21853268_2	first, we checked the functionality of mir-132 binding sites in the 3' -utr of human hbegf.
21853268_3	for this experiment the luciferase reporter gene was fused with the 3'utr sequences of human hbegf, and this vector was co-transfected with pre-mir-132 or negative control oligos into cho cells.
21853268_5	next, we examined whether hbegf is regulated by mir-132 at the protein level in mouse mast cells.
21853268_6	thus, the exogenous delivery and knockdown of mir-132 clearly prove that mir-132 controls hbegf protein levels in activated mast cells.
19073608_3	bioinformatic predictions suggest that the human egfr mrna 3'-untranslated region contains three microrna-7 target sites, which are not conserved across mammals.
19073608_4	we found that mir-7 down-regulates egfr mrna and protein expression in cancer cell lines via two of the three sites, inducing cell cycle arrest and cell death.
19073608_5	because mir-7 was shown to decrease egfr mrna expression, we used microarray analysis to identify additional mrna targets of mir-7.
19073608_7	furthermore, mir-7 attenuated activation of protein kinase b and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 2, two critical effectors of egfr signaling, in different cancer cell lines.
19073608_8	these data establish an important role for mir-7 in controlling mrna expression and indicate that mir-7 has the ability to coordinately regulate egfr signaling in multiple human cancer cell types.
26095125_1	as expected, we observed a significantly lower expression of direct mir-29 ecm protein targets in pscs transfected with mir-29 mimics compared to cells transfected with control mimic.
25897249_1	mir-27a directly targets various regions of the 3'utr to repress the endogenous expression of foxo1 in breast cancer.
26840300_1	taken together, these data indicated that mir-30a-5p, mir-30b-5p and mir-30e-5p directly target the 3'utr of mbnl2, whereas mbnl3 is a direct target gene of mir-30a-5p and mir-30e-5p only.
24480980_2	these findings indicated that crk was a direct target of mir-126 and negatively regulated by mir-126 in hscs.
24480980_3	overexpression of mir-126 inhibited hscs activation and migration maybe through directly inhibiting crk expression and indirectly disturbing f-actin.
21481725_1	we identified the pten gene as a target of mirna-221/-222.
21481725_2	meanwhile, overexpression of mir-221/-222 in hek293 cells led to down-regulation of pten expression .
21481725_3	together, these data demonstrate that the pten gene is a target of mir-221/-222.
21481725_4	it is noted that during the preparation of the manuscript, a report was published that showed the pten gene is a target of mir-221 222, supporting our observations . .
21481725_5	together these observations demonstrate that regulation of pten expression by mir-221/-222 leads to radioresistance. in summary, we demonstrate that mir-221 and mir-222 are involved in the regulation of radiosensitivity by targeting the pten akt pathway.
26545810_1	calml5 mrna was up-regulated by the znf750 transcription factor and then stabilized by the long noncoding rna tincr.
26545810_2	taken together, these findings suggested a model in which p63-activated znf750 induces calml5 expression, with calml5 mrna then post-transcriptionally stabilized by tincr.
26545810_3	tincr rna interactome analysis sequencing identified apeak in the calml5 3'-untranslated region , indicating that calml5 mrna could be a tincr stabilization target .
26545810_4	calml5 mrna, but not the hbp1 control differentiation gene, was significantly less stable with tincr depletion , confirming that tincr promotes calml5 mrna levels through stabilization.
23405269_1	microrna-122 dependent binding of ago2 protein to hepatitis c virus rna is associated with enhanced rna stability and translation stimulation.
23405269_2	here,we show that argonaute 2 protein binds to the hcv 5'-utr in a mir-122-dependent manner, whereas the hcv 3'utr does not bind ago2.
25662849_1	quantitative reverse transcription pcr and western blotting analysis revealed that the expression of pten was increased after downexpression of mir-494-3p in glioma cells .
25662849_2	mir-494-3p can target the pten mrna.
25662849_3	both in the glioma cell lines u251 and u87, mir-494-3p inhibitor can enhance the expression of pten to further suppress activated-akt signaling and reduce the ability of invasion and proliferation in glioma cell lines.
26452129_1	the overexpression of mir-506 resulted in a significant decrease in the luciferase activity of the construct containing the wild-type 3'utr of ezh2.
26452129_2	this regulation was abolished when the nucleotides in the putative binding site were mutated , indicating that the mir-506-mediated regulation of ezh2 expression depended on its binding to a specific seed region in the ezh2 3'utr.
26452129_3	therefore, ezh2 plays an important role in the proliferation and metastasis of colon cancer cells, potentially by acting as a mediator of mir-506 function.
22773832_1	the luciferase reporter assay verified lepr as a direct target for mir-21 and mir-130a.
22773832_2	together, these results confirmed that mir-21 and mir-130a have a direct effect on lepr, mediated through 3'utr target sites.
22773832_3	our data identified lepr as a novel target for mir-21 and mir-130a, implicating their role in the inhibition of wound healing and pathology of vus.
22773832_4	our study identified and confirmed lepr as a novel target for the most induced mir-21 and mir-130a in epidermis, suggesting that exogenous leptin would not improve healing of chronic vus.
21730150_1	in pancreatic -beta cells, c-rel and p65 of the nf-κb family activated the mir21 gene promoter and increased mir-21 rna levels; mir-21 in turn decreased the level of pdcd4, which is able to induce cell death through the bax family of apoptotic proteins.
20795863_1	we show that mir-184 binds bin3 3'utr and while bin3 mrna expression was equal in both cell lines, the protein expression was inversely correlated with mir-184 expression.
20795863_2	these results indicate that mir-184 can bindto the predicted binding site in bin3 3'utr, and influence post-transcriptional regulation of bin3 expression.
20795863_4	western blotting of bin3 protein in both cell lines demonstrated a higher level in sra01 04 cells compared to hle-b3 , in agreement with the much lower expression of mir-184 in sra01 04 compared to hle-b3 cells.
26741509_1	we found that mir-454 targeted the 3'utr of cxcl12 mrna to inhibit its protein translation in human lung epithelial cells.
26741509_3	the luciferase activities in these cells showed that mir-454 targeted 3'utr of cxcl12 mrna to inhibit its translation .
22252650_1	in addition, we demonstrated that cpt induced apoptosis in cancer cells by mir-125b-mediated mitochondrial pathways via targeting to the 3'-untranslated regions of bak1, mcl1, and p53.
20874002_2	these data indicate egfr mrna is a functional downstream targetfor mir-146b-5p.
20874002_3	these results suggest that mir-146b-5p regulation of egfr protein expression is due to inhibition of translation via direct binding to egfr mrna.
20979124_2	furthermore, we transfected mir-194 inhibitors with luciferase reporter constructs to hepg2 cells, in which mir-194 was highly expressed, to study the knockdown effects of mir-194 in epithelial cells .
20979124_3	the inhibitors significantly released the repression by mir-194 on the luciferase genes with the 3'-utrs of n-cadherin, hbegf, rac1, ptpn12, itga9, socs2, and dnmt3a.
20979124_4	we also found that mir-194 inhibitors caused a significant increase of endogenous n-cadherin, hbegf, and igf1r mrna levels in hepg2 cells . in contrast, the inhibitors did not affect the expression of dnmt3b, which does not have a predictable mir-194 binding site in its 3'utr in conclusion, mir-194 may suppress metastasis of liver cancer cells by targeting several genes that function at the different stages of hcc progression and metastasis.
22344686_1	mir-21 is located in the 3'utr of tmem49 gene.
25749519_1	the increased expression of myo10 was also observed in nsclc, particularly in lymph node-positive ones ,4b, and was negatively correlated with mir-124 level in nsclc tissue biopsies .4c. this prompted us to study the expression of myo10 in ectopic mir-124 expressed cells revealing a significant down-regulation .4d. ectopic mir-124 repressed the activity of myo10 wild-type 3'utr reporter constructs in dual luciferase reporter assays ,4f, while mutation in mir-124-binding site completely abrogated this repression.
25749519_2	therefore, it was demonstrated that the myo10 expression could be directly regulated by mir-124 via conserved seed-matching sequences and correlates with the node metastasis of nsclc disease.
19584269_1	endogenous mir-661 expression was positively regulated by the c ebpalpha transcription factor, which is down-regulated during cancer progression.
19584269_2	c ebpalpha directly interacted with the mir-661 chromatin and bound to mir-661 putative promoter that contains a c ebpalpha-consensus motif. in addition, we found that the level of mta1 protein was progressively up-regulated, whereas that of mir-661 and its activator, c ebpalpha, were down-regulated in a breast cancer progression model consisting of mcf-10a cell lines whose phenotypes ranged from noninvasive to highly invasive.
19584269_3	c ebpalpha expression in breast cancer cells resulted in increased mir-661 expression and reduced mta1 3'utr-luciferase activity and mta1 protein level.
19584269_5	we believe our findings show for the first time that c ebpalpha regulates the level of mir-661 and in turn modifies the functions of the mir661-mta1 pathway in human cancer cells.
19584269_6	based on these findings, we suggest that mir-661 be further investigated for therapeutic use in down-regulating the expression of mta1 in cancer cells.
26609479_1	we identified rab11a as a direct target of mir-320a and showed that its expression was upregulated in tumor samples and inversely correlated with the expression of mir-320a.
26609479_2	rab11a was identified as a target gene of mir-320a and shown to mediate its tumor suppressor effect via the modulation of associated proliferative signaling pathways.
26609479_3	collectively, these results suggest that rab11a is a target of mir-320a.
26609479_4	we identified rab11a as a direct target of mir-320a in bc cells, and showed that the tumor suppressor activity of mir-320a is mediated by the modulation of rab11a expression.
26909612_1	both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that ectopic stable expression mir-194 suppressed proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis and induced apoptosis in nsclc cells and that this suppression could be reversed by reintroducing forkhead box a1 , a functional target of mir-194.
26909612_2	we also provide experimental evidence that mir-194 regulated cellular function via directly interacting with the foxa1 mrna at the 3'utr.
26909612_3	in this study, we have demonstrated a mechanism that mir-194 was decreased in clinical nsclc tissues compared to adjacent normal lung tissues and that mir-194 played a critical role in nsclc progression by regulating cell proliferation and invasion via negatively regulate foxa1.
25486484_2	2c, downregulation of mir-155 results in restoration of stat4 expression in myla ctcl malignant cells.

20451302_1	we tested whether mir-144 also regulates endogenous atxn1 levels within cells at the posttranscriptional level.
20451302_2	atxn1 3=utr contains 3 conserved and 2 nonconserved binding elements for mir-144 .
20451302_3	first, overexpression of either mir-144 or -101 duplex rna and atxn1 sirna in 293t cells resulted in a significant decrease in endogenous atxn1 protein levels as assessed by western blotting .
20451302_4	the results indicated that mir-144 and -101 reduced considerably atxn1 protein expression suggesting that both mirnas act as translational repressors.
20451302_5	we also noticed that mir-101 and -144 consensus elements are evolutionary conserved and partially overlap within atxn1 3'utr, suggesting that the mechanism of atxn1 regulation by mir-144 and -101 is conserved in primates.
20451302_6	taken together, our results suggest that mirnas, and mir-144 in particular, are an important component of atxn1 regulatory pathway.
20451302_7	fig. 4. regulation of ataxin 1 expression by mir-144 and mir-101. in conclusion, these data indicate that mir-144 has the ability to bind directly to the atxn1 3'utr and suppress the translation of atxn1.
25483699_2	pylori-induced gastric inflammatory reaction via up-regulating microrna-155 to inhibit th17 responses, implying that the microrna-155 il-17 pathway was involved.
25483699_3	further study is required to elucidate the relationship between mirna-155 and il-17.
25483699_4	we found that the production of il-17 was significantly increased after the expression of mirna-155 being down-regulated; however, the production of il-17 was significantly decreased after the expression of mirna-155 being upregulated.
19524507_6	indeed, rhoa re-expression partially reverses mir-31-imposed metastasis suppression.

26191190_2	furthermore, knockdown of ezh2 have the same effect with mir-1297 overeexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
26191190_3	these findings provide evidence that mir-1297 plays a key role in inhibition of the hepatocellular carcinoma cells proliferation, and enhancing cell apoptosis through targeting ezh2, and strongly suggest that exogenous mir-1297 may have therapeutic value in treating hepatocellular carcinoma.
25936394_2	gk5 downregulation is associated with mir-135b expression in glioblastoma.
25936394_3	gk5 is a target of mir- 135b in u87mg glioblastoma cells.
25175984_1	in addition, we demonstrated that decreased expression of ship1 in the aml cell lines was a consequence of increased levels of mir-155 and can therefore be reversed in vitro through inhibition of mir-155, with subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation and promotion of cell apoptosis.
25175984_2	in conclusion, expression of the ship1 protein is targeted by mir-155 in aml.
25175984_3	mir-155 acts as an onco-mir, and the mir-155 ship1 pi3k akt signaling pathway could play an important role in the pathogenesis of aml.
26201895_2	the results demonstrated that ccnd3 was significantly downregulated while mir-138 was upregulated in h460 and spc-a1 cells.
26201895_3	since we showed that ccnd3 was directly targeted by mir-138 and mediated by mir-138 in nsclc, we speculated that ccnd3 could have functional mechanisms in regulating nsclc.
26201895_4	overall, our serial two-step transfection experiments all demonstrated that the anti-cancer effects of mir-138 upregulation were all reversed by ccnd3 overexpression, thus suggesting that ccnd3 was actively involved in mir-138 regulation in nsclc.
25384965_3	induction of mir-193b in ssc fibroblasts suppressed, and accordingly, knockdown of mir-193b increased the levels of messenger rna and protein for upa.
26609496_1	since mir-182 and mir-96 target reck, we examined the effect of knocking down their expression, as well as that of mir-183 from the same cluster, on the level of reck mrna expression by transfecting their anti-mirs in ht-1080 and bph-1 cells.

26885452_4	taken together, our data showed that mir-610 negatively modulated hdgf expression by directly binding to its 3'utr.
26885452_5	further study showed that hdgf is a direct target gene of mir-610, and its expression inversely correlated with mir-610 expression in crc clinical specimens.
22028478_1	two mir-130a binding sites were identified in the 3'-untranslated region of the smad4 mrna.
22028478_2	these data support the idea that mir-130a is involved in translational repression of smad4 mrna.
22028478_3	this shows that overexpression of mir-130a can decrease the smad4 level sufficiently to reduce expression from a smad4-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid.
22028478_4	together, these results show that the reduced smad4 level in cells with high mir-130a expression lowers the sensitivity to tgf--beta1 stimulation and allows the cells to continue their proliferation at a higher rate without inducing apoptosis or granulocytic maturation.
22028478_5	together, these results show that mir-130a appears to regulate smad4 expression by binding to the 2 predicted targetsites in smad4 3'utr.
22028478_6	this shows that mir-130a does take part in regulating smad4 in this aml-derived cell line.
17540599_1	one important role of mir-34a is the modulation and fine-tuning of the gene expression program initiated by p53 for mir-34a-responsive genes are highly enriched for those that regulate cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, dna repair, and angiogenesis.
23516376_1	from the eight genes that were tested, including sox11, six were down-regulated in response to hsa-mir-204 mimic; the five reduced in h36ce cells were also significantly elevated following transfection with hsa-mir-204 inhibitor .
23204229_1	mir-204 target and suppresses sox4 and ephb2 expression.
23204229_2	as shown in fig.5c, ectopic expression of mir-204 markedly decreased, while inhibition of mir-204 significantly elevated, the reporter luciferase activities , suggesting that mir-204 post-transcriptionally inhibited sox4 and ephb2 expression.
23204229_3	this observation indicates mir-204 may act as regulator for sox4 and ephb2 expression in clinical glioma specimens.
20655737_1	mir-193b directly represses the expressions of ccnd1 and ets1 through their 3'-utrs.

19486339_2	at least 50% of the tumor samples showed a greater than two-fold increase in the expression for mir-18 and for the mir-106b-25 cluster when compared with the corresponding paired non-tumor samples.
19486339_3	knock-down studies for the mir-106b-25 cluster, which includes mir-106b, mir-93 and mir-25, showed that the expression of the cluster is necessary for cell proliferation and for anchorage-independent growth.
19486339_5	we further identified the transcription factor e2f1 as a target gene for mir-106b and mir-93 and it is likely that one of the roles of the mir-106b-25 cluster is to prevent excessively high e2f1 expression, which may then cause apoptosis.
19486339_6	we conclude that there is aberrant expression of micrornas encoded by the oncogenic mir-17-92 cluster and the mir-106b-25 cluster in hepatocellular carcinoma.
20226166_1	we performed a qpcr analysis of mir-375, yap isoform 1 , and yap isoform 2 in 48 pairs of hcc tumor and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues.
20226166_2	it is noteworthy that both isoforms of yap contain the same 3'utr regions, and the results showed that mir-375 was significantly down-regulated in hcc tumor tissues, while both isoforms of yap were up-regulated in hcc tumor tissues, suggesting yap is a target of mir-375 .
20226166_3	yap is a direct target of mir-375. in contrast, the luciferase activity of the mutant reporter was unaffected by cotransfection of mir-375 , indicating mir-375 suppressed gene expression through mir-375-binding sequence at the 3'utr of yap.

26331031_3	taken together, these findings show that mirna-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of the atxn1 gene may modulate sca1-related neuropathology by affecting protein levels.
26456956_1	furthermore, mir-329 significantly regulated cell invasion by targeting brd4 but had noeffecton cell proliferation and apoptosis.
26456956_2	furthermore, we identified that mir-329 could regulate hcc cell invasion via targeting brd4. in sum, these results implied that mir-329 could regulate brd4 expression by binding its 3'utr.
26456956_3	to better understand the mechanisms of mir-329 in hcc cell invasion, we identified mir-329 regulating brd4 in hcc using luciferase reporter and western blot assays.
25682742_1	in this study, we not only showed that anubl1 as an oncogene was upregulated and could promote proliferation of sgc-7901 cells, but also demonstrated that its over expression led to a strong decrease of mir-182 expression and expression of anubl1 was in turn directly downregulated by mir-182, thereby establishing a negative feedback loop between mir-182 and anubl1.
25682742_2	the result showed that mir-182 indeed downregulated anubl1 mrna expression in sgc-7901 cells .

19223090_2	mir-126 interacts with vegf-a 3'utr. in order to test whether mir-126 is indeed capable of regulating vegf-a protein expression via the binding site in vegf-a 3'utr, we cloned the predicted mir-126 binding site from cdna library downstream the firefly luciferase coding region in pmir-reporttm luciferase vector .
19223090_3	these results suggested that mir-126 could inhibit vegf-a expression.
18794849_2	in addition, to validate whether reck is a direct target of mir-21, we mutated the mir-21 binding site in the 3'utr of reck and observed loss of repression .
18794849_3	these results all indicate reck is a direct target of mir-21.
26302774_1	these data strongly suggest that mir-376b may target nfkbiz and stat3 in hepatocytes, and the downregulation of mir-376b in the regenerating liver tissue may lead to the increased expression of nfkbiz and stat3.
26080838_1	the result indicated that the fragment at the 3'-utrs of the rps6kb1 mrna was the complementary site for the mir-195 seed region, suggesting that rps6kb1 was the direct target of mir-195.
26080838_2	overall, mir-195 negatively regulated rps6kb1 expression in vitro and in vivo.
25216407_1	the expression level of mir-185, indicated by real-time pcr, was significantly reduced , while that of hif-2alpha was increased in the sw620 colon cancer cells.

26229046_2	hsa-mir-27a level in human livers was significantly in spearman rank correlated with cyp3a4 mrna level and protein level as well as showed significant linear regression with cyp3a4 mrna level and protein level .
24821285_1	microrna-200c downregulates xiap expression to suppress proliferation and promote apoptosis of triple-negative breast cancer cells.
18802929_3	more interestingly, hsa-mir-34b was found to be down-regulated only in bl cases that were negative for myc translocation, suggesting that this event might be responsible for c-myc deregulation in such cases.
18802929_4	this hypothesis was further confirmed by our in vitro experiments, which demonstrated that increasing doses of synthetic hsa-mir-34b were able to modulate c-myc expression.
18802929_5	these results indicate for the first time that hsa-mir-34b may influence c-myc expression in burkitt lymphoma as the more common aberrant control exercised by the immunoglobulin enhancer locus.
26549025_1	mechanistically, bc032469 could directly bind to mir-1207-5p and effectively functioned as a sponge for mir-1207-5p to modulate the derepression of htert.
26549025_2	thus, bc032469 may function as a cerna to impair mir-1207-5p-dependent htert downregulation, suggesting that it may be clinically valuable as a poor prognostic biomarker of gastric cancer.
26549025_3	our previous study has demonstrated that mir-1207-5p and mir-1266 could inhibit htert expression at the post-transcriptional level by directly binding to the 3'utr of the htert mrna.
26549025_6	we hypothesized that lncrna bc032469 might have the same interaction with mir-1207-5p and mir-1266 to regulate expression of htert.
26719072_2	the result showed that mir-203 downregulated sik1 expression by targeting its 3'utr in pancreatic cancer and that sik1 was downregulated in pancreatic cancer cells, due to the overexpression of mir-203.

23601686_2	we found that the amounts of socs-1 transcripts were inversely related to the cellular content of mir-155, with the highest concentration of socs-1 in mir155-/- cells and the lowest in mir-155 transduced cells .
23601686_3	these results were further confirmed at the protein level, indicating that mir-155 is a critical regulator of socs-1 translation in cd8+ t cells .
23601686_4	together, these results demonstrate that socs-1 is negatively regulating the effector cd8+ t cell response to virus and cancer and highlight the importance of socs-1 downregulation by mir-155 for efficient cd8+ t cell responses.
26095359_1	of note, glua1 mrna expression was unaffected by mir-137, suggesting that the changes in glua1 protein levels by mir-137 is regulated at the level of translation rather than transcription .
26095359_2	we observed a significant increase in surface glua1 expression at synapses of sponge-mir-137-expressing hippocampal neurons, whereas sglua1 levels were reduced during mir-137 overexpression , supporting the notion that ampar subtype glua1 is directly targeted by mir-137.

26693054_2	as shown in figure 2b, the expression level of pxn mrna in all the cell lines was negatively associated with mir-212 expression.
26693054_4	the results make it evident that mir-212 effects pxn expression by directly binding to the 3'utr region of pxn.
26693054_5	transfection of mir-212 results in a marked reduction of pxn mrna levels in both cell lines compared with that of the nc cells.
22963810_1	a luciferase reporter assay showed that mir-1 regulation was established by pairing to a complementary binding site within the et-1 3'utr.
22963810_5	here, et-1 levels were significantly induced after mir-1 silencing, suggesting that 2-om blocks mir-1-induced et-1 repression, providing further confirmation that mir-1 target et-1.
22963810_6	taken together, our data demonstrated that mir-1 could bindwith the targetsite in et-1's 3'utr to inhibit et-1 expression.

21730286_3	the inhibitory role of mir-146a on notch1 is mainly through posttranscriptional control since it does not change the mrna level of notch1 .
22747855_1	indeed, stable expression of mir-376a and mir-376c in melanoma cells led to a decrease in igf1r mrna and protein, and a luciferase reporter assay indicated that the 3'utr of igf1r is a target of both mir-376a and mir-376c.

18645025_4	the finding that the mir-451 target mdr1 suggested that down-regulation of expression of this mirna contributes to the cancer drug resistance; therefore, the restoration of a mir-451 level in the resistant mcf-7 dox cells may increase their sensitivity to dox.

21790228_4	the above findings were further confirmed that mir-143 significantly inhibits proliferation and migration by decreasing the level of cox-2.
25356105_3	mechanistically, we demonstrated that overexpression of mir-183 decreased, and inhibition of mir-183 increased the expression of pdcd4, a tumor suppressor, at both mrna and protein levels.

23173671_2	furthermore, sirna-mediated knockdown of mtor partially phenocopied the effect of mir-99a overexpression, suggesting that the tumor suppressive role of mir-99a may be mediated primarily through mtor regulation.
23173671_3	the enforced expression of mir-99a in rcc cell lines led to a decrease in mtor protein and also led to a decrease in phospho-mtor protein, compared with nc transfectants .

26482618_1	to verify whether akt3 is a direct target of mir-29a in ptc, a human akt3 3'utr fragment containing the binding sites of mir-29a or the mutant sites was cloned into the pgl3 vector.
26482618_2	these results indicated that mir-29a can bind directly to akt3 and inhibits its expression.
26590574_1	in addition, mir-10a was found to target bcl6 and regulated its expression in transcription and translation levels.
26590574_2	these findings showed that mir-10a targeted to bcl6 and regulated its expression in transcription and translation levels.

20609388_2	4, the levels of brn-3b, but not of brn-3a, are markedly reduced upon the co-transfection of mir-23 and mir-214, thus suggesting a direct effect of the micrornas on the 3'utr of endogenous brn-3b.
20609388_3	furthermore, while mir-23 alone has no effect, endogenous brn-3b mrna levels are reduced following the transfection of mir 214 on its own.
20609388_4	this is likely due to a cooperative effect of the exogenously transfected mir-214 with endogenous mir-23.
25651400_1	these results suggest that stat5 is an important target gene of mir-204 in the b-cell lymphoma.
21646425_1	we show here that whereas dna methylation at the mct1 promoter is unlikely to be involved in cell-type-specific transcriptional repression, three micrornas , mir-29a, mir-29b, and mir-124, selectively targetboth human and mouse mct1 3' untranslated regions.
21646425_3	to test the combined effect of multiple mirnas on the mouse mct1 3'utr, mir-29a, mir-29b, and mir-124 were tested individually and together by luciferase assay .
21646425_5	overexpression of mir-124 produced a statistically significant decrease in the endogenous mct1 mrna level.
21646425_6	this confirms that mir-124 is able to targetnaturally occurring mct1 mrna and that this results in mrna degradation.
21646425_7	this suggests that mir-29a and mir-29b may targetmct1 at least partially through mrna degradation.
22967897_2	two anti-apoptotic genes, aeg-1 and bcl-2, are identified as targets of mir-136, and restoration of aeg-1 or bcl-2 expression suppresses mir-136-enhanced apoptosis.
22156303_2	the abca1 3'utr harbors three closely spaced overlapping predicted mir-33a b target sites, and fusion of the abca1 3'utr fragment containing these sites to a luciferase reporter confirmed that mir-33a b can indeed regulate the abca1 3'utr through the mir-33 binding sites, as shown by site-directed mutagenesis .
22156303_3	taken together, the targeting of abca1 by mir-33a b and the apparent cooperativity of mir-33 and srebp adds an elegant layer of regulation to the cholesterol homeostasis mechanism, and supports the idea that mir-33a b may represent attractive therapeutic targets to raise hdl and ameliorate atherosclerosis.
21310851_1	taken together, these results indicated that hsa-mir-613 targeted lxralpha 3'utr through 613mre.

22387553_5	hairpin inhibitors of mir-30b induced upregulation of bcl6 and socs1, whereas inhibitors of mir-155 upregulated only socs1.
22387553_6	kd of mir-21 resulted in upregulation of dusp-10 yet had no effect on bcl6, which lacks the targetsequence for mir-21.

26201446_1	mir-504 can target many transcription factors, including nrf1.
26201446_2	we extracted total rna and the cne2-nc and cne2-mir-504 proteins at different time points and used rt-pcr and western blot to determine the mrna and protein level, respectively, of nrf1 .5c. the data revealed that the mrna expression level of nrf1 was only slightly down-regulated in cne2-mir-504 cells at different time points.
26201446_3	however, the protein expression level of nrf1 was substantially down-regulated in cne2-mir-504 cells.
26201446_4	results indicated that the protein expression level of nrf1 was obviously up-regulated in cne2-ir-anti-mir-504 cells, suggesting that inhibiting the expression of mir-504 can lead to up-regulation of the nrf1 protein level.
26201446_5	, we found that nrf1 has one mir-504 binding site at 506-513 of the 3'utr, a position that is shared by many species, including humans .5e. we then constructed a nrf1-3'utr plasmid that contains the putative mir-504 binding site and a nrf1-3'utr-mut plasmid that has mutant sequences in the mir-504 binding site.

26663087_2	this suggests that the in vivo anabolicaction of mir-874-3p is also mediated through hdac1 repression and runx2 activation.
26663087_3	we likewise propose a pathway in which mir-874-3p down-regulates hdac1 expression to enhance runx2 expression and osteoblast differentiation.
25912033_1	using the target prediction analysis, we found that a conserved sequence in the 3'utr of klf11 mrna has a perfect match to the seed sequence of mir-30.

12573261_1	antisense transcripts at the emx2 locus in human and mouse conservation of functional human and murineemx2 antisense genes, of overlap between the sense and the antisense transcripts, and of identical cellular expression patterns suggests a biological function for emx2os, presumably to regulate emx2. in situ hybridization of mouseendometrial tissues at other estrous cycle stages produced similar results, with no appreciable difference in the cellular location of emx2 and emx2os .
12573261_2	these studies demonstrate that emx2 and emx2os and their murineorthologs have coincident cellular expression patterns in the endometrium.
19460962_1	conversely, inhibiting mir-92a by antagomir-92a treatment in mice increased the expression of itga5 mrna and protein in the vasculature of skeletal muscle tissue .
26743123_1	psen1 is a direct target of mir-193a-3p in oesophageal cancer cells.

26619802_2	luciferase activity was significantly decreased in cells co-transfected with pre-mir-140 and nfya-3'utr-wt, suggesting that nfya was a direct target of mir-140.
26619802_3	these results suggested that nfya was a direct target of mir-140 with the specific binding site.
26619802_4	mechanistic investigations defined nfya as a direct and functional downstream target of mir-140, which was involved in the malat1 knockdown induced regulation of the integrity and permeability of btb, as well as the expression of zo-1, occludin, and claudin-5.
21643012_1	thus, mir-27a negatively regulates igf-1 expression in ewing sarcoma.
21643012_2	as shown in figure 3f, compared with negative control, mir-100 robustly inhibited reporter expression through its predicted site in the igf-1r 3'utr, but had no effect when the mir seed sequence was mutated.
21643012_3	similarly, mir-125b specifically inhibited reporter activity through its predicted site in the rsk1 3'utr .
21643012_4	surprisingly, we were unable to demonstrate direct regulation of the igf-1 3'utr by mir-27a , suggesting that the regulation of igf-1 protein levels occurs via other mechanisms.
19962668_1	mir-221 and mir-222 directly targetpten and timp3 3'utrs.
19962668_2	conversely, when we performed luciferase assays by using a plasmid harboring the 3'utr of pten and timp3 mrnas, where the binding sites for mir-221 and mir-222 were inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis, we observed a consistent reduction in mir-221&222 inhibitory effect .
19962668_3	moreover, we found, as assessed by western blot, an inverse correlation between mir-221&222 rna expression and pten and timp3 protein expression in most cell lines analyzed , confirmed also by qrt-pcr .
19962668_4	these data further support the finding that pten is a direct target of mir-221&222 also in vivo.
19962668_5	interestingly, we observed a significant increase on the migratory and invasive capabilities of h460 and sk-hep1 cells after mir-221&222 overexpression as well after pten and timp3 downregulation.
26116834_2	previous results showed that also in our model, mir-21 targets the 3'utr of pten mrna.
26116834_3	real time pcr analysis demonstrated that the addition of curcumin, to cml cells, for 24 hours, caused a dose-dependent increase in pten mrna .
26116834_5	our data indicate that the curcumin treatment induces an exosomes-mediated decrease of mir-21 that in turn causes the modulation of pten expression in cml cells, confirmed by the study of gain and loss of function for mir-21.
26729197_1	thus, mir-31 could target itga5 mrna and negatively regulate its expression.
23175429_1	overexpression of mir-16-1 attenuated migration and invasion of glioma cells, and u251 cells transfected with mir-16-1 showed significantly lower endogenous mrna levels of zyxin than those transfected with nonspecific control mirna or mock . in summary, we demonstrated that mir-16-1 expression was markedly decreased in human glioma cell lines, and for the first time, described the roles of mir-16-1 in cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of high-invasive glioma cells, and suggested that zyxin may be one of putative target genes of mir-16-1.
17443681_1	3' untranslated regions of the genes and experimentally established kcnq1 and kcne1 as target for repression by muscle specifeid micrornas mir-133 and mir-1.
17443681_2	our experiments demonstrated that kcne1 is critically regulated by mir-1, but not by mir-133; mir-1 produced some 79% abrogation of the luciferase activity reported by the vectors carrying the 3'utr of kcne1 and 70% reduction of kcne1 protein level .
17443681_4	the kcne1 mrna was unaffected by mir-1 .
22132820_1	as the binding site of rnd3 is conserved between human and mouse species, we sought to validate the regulation of rnd3 by mir-17 through a luciferase reporter assay that could verify the direct interaction between mir-17 and the rnd3 3'utr.
22132820_2	overexpression of mir-17 reduced luciferase activity from the reporter vector containing the 3'utr of rnd3 .
22132820_3	moreover, mutation of the putative binding site on the rnd3 3'utr abrogated this repression, supporting the direct interaction of mir-17 with rnd3.
22132820_4	this result suggests that mir-17 may directly regulate the expression of endogenous rnd3.
22132820_5	this result confirmed that rnd3 mediated the effect of mir-17 on promoting cell proliferation and cell cycle progression.
26800397_1	ppp2r2a is a known target of mir-222 in hepatocellular cancer cells 4. we observed that mir-222 overexpression significantly down-恟egulated ppp2r2a expression, whereas knock-恉own of endogenous mir-222 up-恟egulated the ppp2r2a level .
26800397_2	data from the dual luciferase assay showed that mir-222 decreased the luciferase activity of wild-恡ype pmir-怭pp2r2a-3'utr but not that of the mutated pmir-怭pp2r2a-3'utr .
26800397_3	hese results indicated that ppp2r2a was a direct target of mir-222 in bladder cancer cells in a manner associated with mir-222-恑nduced proliferation.
25876455_1	therefore, we hypothesized that downregulation of mir-27a might play a role in mediating tlr4-mediated secondary inflammatory damage after ir by up-regulating the ticam-2 transcript.
25876455_2	these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the ir-mediated reduction in mir-27a down-regulates ticam-2 expression, which in turn influences tlr4 signaling and the activation of downstream inflammatory cytokines.
24065131_1	in contrast, ryhb pairing to cira mrna promotes changes in rna structure that displace hfq, thereby allowing efficient translation as well as mrna stabilization.
26275944_1	meantime, luciferase reporter assays identified zeb1 as a direct target of mir-205 in eoc cells.
26275944_2	mir-205, acting as an oncogenic mirna, may promote the clinical progression of eoc patients and enhance the cellular motility in vitro by directly and negatively regulating zeb1, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for suppression of eoc metastasis. in addition, we confirmed that mir-205 could directly and negatively regulate zeb1 in eoc cells, the evidence for which were from the following sources: , the endogenous mir-205 level was higher, whereas zeb1 level was lower in eoc cells and tissue samples, indicating the inverse correlation of them; ,the alteration of mir-205 expression in eoc cells resulted intheopposite change of zeb1 expression, highlighting their negatively regulation; and , zeb1 mrna 3'utr could bear a binding site of mir-205.
25906693_1	we also revealed that jund is a target of mir-494.
25906693_2	western blotting analysis demonstrated that treatment with the lentiviral antigomir-494 vector resulted in increased expression of jund and decreased expression of cytochrome c .
21402938_1	examination of the sequence of the orf56 primase 3'utr with several mirna target prediction programs suggested two likely targets for mir-k5jone in exon 1 of the orf57 gene, and one in exon 2 of the gene.
21402938_2	the sequences of these target sites, and their predicted basepairing with mir-k5, are shown in fig.
22844247_2	let-7b and let-7c directly downregulate ksrp mrna during pituitary development.
21149267_1	here, we show the 3'utr of cd44 is able to antagonize cytoplasmic mirnas, and result in the increased translation of cd44 and downstream targetmrna, cdc42.
21149267_2	computational algorithms have predicted three mirnas, mir-216a, mir-330 and mir-608, can bindto both the cd44 and cdc42 3'-utrs.
26851511_3	these results suggested that mir-18a b could target 3'utr of igf-1 by complementary base-pairing to its target site, as predicted.
26851511_4	these results further supported the idea that igf-1 was a downstream target of mir-18b during hrecs proliferation.
26818663_1	transfection of intestinal cells with a mir-7 mimic or inhibitor confirmed its negative regulatory effect on rnf183 expression and ubiquitination of i魏balpha.
26818663_2	conversely, the mir-7 inhibitor significantly up-regulated the expression of rnf183, suggesting that mir-7 may be a direct regulator of rnf183 at both the transcriptional and translational levels.
26818663_3	we further determined that mir-7 is a negative regulator of rnf183 through direct interaction with the 3'utr of rnf183 to inhibit its translation.
20159450_1	we identified nmda receptor subunit nr2a as a target of mir-125b and show that nr2a mrna is specifically associated with fmrp in brain.
20159450_2	together these data indicate that neuronal mir-125 can specifically regulate nr2a reporter expression.
20159450_3	these data extend the findings using ff-luc reporters and demonstrate that mir-125b specifically regulates endogenous nr2a in neurons.
20159450_4	together these data indicate that endogenous mir-125 directly and specifically regulates nr2a expression and affects nmda receptor function accordingly.
20159450_5	together these data indicate that the 3'utr of nr2a is normally suppressed by fmrp and ago1 as well as by mir-125, and these mechanisms show partial functional interaction.
20219912_1	here, we report that cellular mrnas encoding the cellular cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a key inducer of cell cycle arrest, are direct targets for kshv mir-k1.
20219912_2	ectopically expressed kshv mir-k1 specifically inhibited the expression of endogenous p21 in kshv-negative cells and strongly attenuated the cell cycle arrest that normally occurs upon p53 activation.
20698883_1	il6r is a candidate target of mir-23a.
20698883_2	three binding sites of mir-23a were found in the 3'utr of il6r mrna.
20698883_3	these observations suggest that mir-23a bindainly to the first targeting site of the il6r mrna 3'utr and represses gene expression.
20698883_4	these data highlight the prediction that il6r is a direct target of mir-23a.
20698883_5	figure 5b shows that, compared with normal tissue samples, il6r mrna was consistently downregulated in gastric cancer tissue samples. in addition, knockdown or overexpression of mir-23a also enhanced or decreased il6r protein expression, respectively .
20698883_6	this suggests that mir-23a promotes mgc803 cell growth by negatively regulating il6r.
21149577_2	the human tr-beta1 mrna was predicted to have other binding sites for mir-27a, and the luciferase activity of a human tr-beta1 3'utr reporter was decreased significantly by mir-27a .
21149577_3	these findings suggested that the binding sites of mir-27a in the 3'utr of tr-beta1 could mediate translational repression by mir-27a.
21149577_4	these findings indicated that tr-beta1 is a target of mir-27a both in rat and human cells.
21149577_5	because mir-27a could upregulate the -beta-mhc gene under serum-containing conditions, these results indicated that the upregulation of -beta-mhc by mir-27a resulted mainly from the downregulation of tr-beta1 rather than rxralpha.
21149577_6	these findings suggested that the upregulation of mir-27a could increase -beta-mhc mrna levels via tr-beta1 but did not affect cardiac cell differentiation in mousees cells.
21149577_7	as a result, during heart development, mir-27a and tr-beta1 mrna levels increased continuously while -beta-mhc levels decreased .
26707794_1	adamts5 gene 3'utr carries a putative hsa-mir-15a binding site and is negatively regulated by hsa-mir-15a.
26707794_2	the results revealed that a binding site for hsa-mir-15a was in the adamts5 mrna 3'utr .
26707794_3	these results suggest that hsa-mir-15a binds directly to the 3'utr of adamts5 mrna and inhibits gene expression.
26707794_4	these results also indicate that adamts5 is a direct target of hsa-mir-15a.
26370615_1	in addition, as determined by luciferase assays and western blotting, smad2, a crucial mediator of pulmonary fibrosis, was identified to be one of target genes of mir-486-5p. in fibroblasts, smad2, a critical mediator of multiple fibrogenic associated-processes, including cell proliferation, migration, invasion and differentiation into myofibroblasts, was identified to be a target gene of mir-486-5p.
26370615_2	these results support the hypothesis that mir-486-5p exerts its anti-fibrotic effects by suppressing collagen synthesis and targeting smad2 directly.
21593139_1	here, we show that the 3'utr of sec23a mrna is indeed a targetfor mir-375 and mir-200c and that both mirnas downregulate sec23a protein expression when ectopically expressed in human 293t cells.
21593139_2	taken together, these results show that the sec23a 3'utr is an independent targetfor both mir-200c and mir-375.
21593139_3	figure 1. sec23a mrna is a targetfor mirnas mir-200c and mir-375.

22024478_3	the mrna and protein expression level of ahr was inhibited by pre and elevated by inh. the results showed that mir-124 indeed regulated expression of ahr by directly targeting its 3'utr.
22024478_4	the results show that the expressions mir-124 and ahr are complementary in clinic and suggest that mir-124 might negatively regulate the expression of ahr in neuroblastoma cells not only in vitro but also in vivo.
22024478_5	these studies support our findings that inhibition of mir-124 caused increasing in ahr and resulted in cell differentiation.
21520166_3	further studies showed that mir-1 was able to enhance the hbv core promoter transcription activity by augmenting farnesoid x receptor alpha expression. in addition, mir-1 arrested the cell cycle at the g phase and inhibited cell proliferation by targeting histone deacetylase 4 and e2f transcription factor 5.
23824072_1	in lymphocytes, c-myb was a direct target of mir-150. in cardiac myocytes, we found that c-myb was also involved in mir-150-mediated h2o2-induced cardiac cell death.
23824072_2	these results suggested that c-myb may be a target gene of mir-150 in cardiac myocytes.
25277326_2	lin28b and nras were targeted by mir-4500.
26450995_1	cited2 was the target of mir-200b and was downregulated by high glucose.
26450995_2	two mir-200b binding sites in the 3'-untranslated region of the cited2 mrna were required for inhibiting cited2 expression.
26450995_3	these results strongly suggest that mir-200b directly interacts with the cited2 mrna and forms the mir-200b cited2-mrna complex.
26450995_4	altogether, these results indicate that mir-200b interacts with cited2 mrna via the specific binding sites located in its 3'utr, and, thus, silencing cited2 expression by degrading mrna and blocking translation.
26619149_2	finally, if phactr4 is a bona fide mir-21 target, its levels should be de-repressed in our crispr cas-edited isogenic scc line that specifically lacked mir-21 .
26619149_3	by exploiting the tcga database and applying both crispr cas and rapid lentiviral-based genetics to skin and head and neck epithelia in mice, we verified the mir-21-independent tumorigenic activity of mir-21 and uncovered phactr4 as a key target whose suppression confers much of the oncogenic activity of this hitherto ignored mirna.
26081980_1	the luciferase reporter assay showed that mir-4649-3p directly targeted shp-1 by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of shp-1 mrna. in conclusion, mir-4649-3p inhibits cell proliferation by targeting shp-1 in npc cells.
26081980_2	the luciferase reporter assay indicated that mir-4649-3p suppressed shp-1 expression by binding to shp-1 3'utr and inhibiting shp-1 mrna translation.
24681041_1	further, we showed that mir-216b could directly target a specific fragment in the 3' untranslated region of beclin 1 as demonstrated by luciferase assay, and consequently decreased the expression of beclin 1. consistently, knocking down beclin 1 significantly decreased hcpt-triggered autophagy and apoptosis, and increased the viability of htfs treated with hcpt,
22431396_3	from in silico analysis and validation experiments, foxo1 was identified as the target of mir-182, and restoration of foxo1 expression in mir-182-overexpressing osteoblasts rescued them from the inhibitory effects of mir-182.

26877261_1	within the notch and wnt clusters specifically, four genes were found to contain predicted mir-375 binding sites.
26877261_2	mir-375 overexpression in variant cell lines resulted in decreased protein expression of both notch2 and rbpj .
26877261_3	furthermore, knockdown of mir-375 in the classic cell line mkl-1 resulted in increased rbpj expression.
26877261_4	the proximal notch2 3'utr contains a highly conserved mir-375 binding site, whereas the 3'utr of rbpj features a poorly conserved binding site.
26877261_5	taken together, our data suggest that mir-375 negatively regulates the notch pathway via direct interactions with the 3' utrs of rbpj and notch2.
20548334_1	jak2 is a mir-375 target overexpression of mir-375 in ags and mgc-803 cells greatly reduced the protein level of jak2, whereas the level of jak2 mrna was not significantly affected , suggesting that mir-375 may suppress jak2 gene expression through translational repression.
20548334_2	these data suggest that mir-375 may inhibit jak2 protein expression through 3'utr at the posttranscriptional level.
20548334_3	taken together, these results are consistent with our hypothesis that mir-375 may inhibit gastric cancer cell proliferation potentially by regulating jak2 expression.

21435193_1	over-expression of mir-211 in melanoma cell lines changed the invasive potential of the cells in vitro through directly targeting brn2 translation.
21435193_2	this increase was not observed upon transfection of a scrambled control lna , suggesting that endogenous mir-211 represses brn2 levels in melanocytic cells.
21435193_3	together, this set of experiments suggest thatthe decrease in brn2 protein levels with mir-211 overexpression is because of direct targeting of brn2 translation by mir-211.

22249254_3	these studies demonstrate that mir-155 and mir-210 are overexpressed in late-stage mds and that, similar to the effects recently shown for mir-155 , mir-210 downregulates ship-1 expression in myeloid cells.
22249254_4	figure 4 mir-210 controls ship-1 expression.
22249254_5	mir-210 binds the 3'utr of ship-1 mrna.

26561465_1	interestingly, a putative conserved binding site for mir-150 was found in the 3'utr of igf2bp1 at 3321- 3328 bp .
26561465_2	luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that the mir-150 had an obvious inhibitory effect on the wild-type but not the mutant 3'utr of igf2bp1 luciferase activity.
26561465_3	we consistently found that overexpression of mir-150 could obviously decrease the expression of endogenous igf2bp1 at the mrna and protein levels in mg63 cells.
26561465_4	these results indicate that mir-150 directly binds to the 3'utr of igf2bp1 to regulate its expression.
21813606_1	subsequent quantitative pcr analyses of these splenic b cells revealed that c ebpbeta, a transcriptional regulator of interleukin-6 that is linked to b-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, is downregulated when either mir-k12-11 or mir-155 is ectopically expressed.
23188671_1	these data demonstrate that mir-153 is a novel regulator of emt by targeting snai1 and zeb2 and indicate its potential therapeutic value for reducing cancer metastasis.
23188671_2	these data indicate that mir-153 regulates snai1 and zeb2 expression through targeting their 3'-utrs that are complementary to the seed region of mir-153.
23188671_3	collectively, the present study revealed a critical inhibitory effect of mir-153 on metastasis via regulation of emt by way of targeting zeb2 and snai1.

21221794_1	epigenetic silencing of mir-137 induced an up-regulation of its target, cdc42.
21221794_2	the relative luciferase activity of the wt construct of cdc42 3'utr in both the gastric cancer cells was significantly reduced in the presence of mir-137 , whereas such a suppressive effect of mir-137 on luciferase activity was not observed in both cells with the mut construct of cdc42 3'utr , highlighting a direct and specific interaction of mir-137 on cdc42 3'utr.
21221794_3	together, these data indicate that cdc42 is a targetfor mir-137 in ags cells.
21221794_4	these findings also suggest that inactivation of cdc42 is involved in mir-137-induced apoptosis.
26052033_2	since the four mir-196a target genes were significantly upregulated in silenced mir-196a net cells, we explored the potential downstream genes of the four direct target genes hoxa9, hoxb7, lrp4 and rspo3.
21820330_1	mir-29-mediated repression of ifn-gamma involves regulation of both t-bet and eomes.
21820330_2	these results demonstrate that both the tbx21 and eomes 3'-utrs are directly responsive to mir-29 and that physiological expression of mir-29 in wild-type helper t cells is sufficient to mediate these effects.
21820330_3	although we must acknowledge that additional mir-29 targets may also contribute, we conclude that mir-29 regulates ifn-gamma production by simultaneously targeting t-bet and eomes, two proteins with overlapping transcriptional activity.
26252186_1	suggesting that the fzd7 mrna, rather than fzd1 and fzd8 mrnas, is a potential target of mir-222.
26252186_2	these results indicate that mir-222 interacts with the fzd7 mrna via its cr, thus repressing fzd7 translation.
25980823_1	by targeting of the smad2-3'utr, mir-148a blocked the expression activation of smad2, and in turn, restored the epithelial characteristics, adhesive abilities, and csc-like properties.
25980823_2	these results suggested that upregulation of mir-148a by gla contributed to suppression of endogenous smad2 in breast cancer cells. in our present study, gla attenuated the endogenous smad2 via upregulation of mir-148a expression.
19221490_1	the mir-34 family regulates cell cycle progression, cellular senescence and apoptosis, but the targets of mir-34 are not completely defined.
19221490_3	sirt1 also regulates p53 dependent apoptosis through deacetylating and stabilizing p53.
19221490_4	we also discovered that sirt1 mediates mir-34a activation of apoptosis by regulating p53 activity.
19221490_5	based on this observation, we propose a positive feedback loop, in which p53 induces expression of mir-34a which suppresses sirt1, increasing p53 activity.

26695693_2	plasma mir-1914 and -1915 interact with nfix rna and reduce its level in chemoresistant crc cells to first-line chemotherapy.
26695693_3	we showed that mir-1914*+mir-1915 suppress crc cell chemoresistance by targeting nfix expression.
21175813_1	among them, mir-29a showed a positive therapeutic effect in liver cancer cells by inhibiting cell growth and inducing cell apoptosis, and ppm1d was confirmed to be the target gene of mir-29a.
21310411_1	ets-1 mrna was downregulated markedly when siets-1 was introduced into huvecs but remained stable in mir-155 or mir-221 222 overexpressed huvecs. in summary, the present study demonstrated that endothelial cells highly express mirnas, including mir-155 and mir-221 222.
21310411_3	fig. 2. ets-1 is a target of both mir-155 and mir-221 222.
25678279_1	furthermore, over-expression of mir-29c effectively reduced birc2 mrna and protein levels, increased infarct volume and apoptosis, and deteriorated neurological outcomes, whereas down-regulation played a neuroprotective role.
15722536_1	in the study reported here, nef-derived mirnas in hiv-1-infected and nef transduced cells were identified, and showed that hiv-1 transcription was suppressed by nef-expressing mirna, mir-n367, in human t cells.
17911266_1	ebv-encoded bart mirnas target the 3'utr of the lmp1 gene and negatively regulate lmp1 protein expression.
17911266_2	four mirnas were examined that lmp1 gene was a target of bart mirnas.
21118818_1	in addition, we found that the sr-family splicing factor sfrs1 is a target for mir-10a -and -10b in hela and sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells.
21118818_2	the discovery of sfrs1 as direct target of mir-10a and -10b supports the emerging functional interaction between two post-transcriptional mechanisms, micrornas and splicing, in the neuronal differentiation context. in addition we could determine that the sr-family splicing factor sfrs1 is a target for mir-10a and -10b action, and we show that changes in mir-10a and -10b expression levels may influence cellular processes in which sfrs1 is involved.
20843712_2	lasp1 might have an oncogenical function in bc, and mir-1, mir-133a, and mir-218 might function as tumor suppressors through repression of lasp1 in bc.
20843712_3	we have demonstrated a strategy to address the mechanisms of cancer development through functional mirnas in bc. the expression levels of lasp1 mrna were significantly decreased in mir-1, mir-218, mir-133a, and mir-145 transfectants compared with the control transfectant , and the protein expression was markedly decreased in the transfectants .
20843712_4	this data suggests that mir-1, mir-218, and mir-133a reduce lasp1 expression through cleavage or translational inhibition.
18201269_1	we demonstrated that overexpression of mir-138 induced a reduction in htert protein expression, and confirmed targetspecificity between mir-138 and the htert 3-untranslated region by luciferase reporter assay.
18201269_2	we then examined whether mir-138 induction was able to repress htert protein expression.
18201269_3	hek-293 cells were transfected with mir-138 precursor molecules, which were designed to directly enter the mirna-processing pathway and mimic endogenous mir-138 in the cells.
18201269_4	overexpression of mir-138 induced a reduction in the htert protein level , but did not affect htert mrna expression .
18201269_5	to further confirm targetspecificity between mir-138 and htert, we carried out a luciferase reporter assay using a vector containing the putative htert utr targetsite downstream of a luciferase reporter gene.
18201269_6	base pairing between mir-138 and the wild-type or mutant putative targetsite is shown in figure 3c. the luciferase activity of hek-293 cells transfected with wild-type htert was significantly lower than that of cells transfected with mutant htert .
18201269_7	these data suggest that the htert gene is one of the target of mir-138, and that mir-138 can downregulate htert protein expression by post-transcriptional repression.
20020497_1	as seen on reporter assaying, mir-212 repressed the construct with the mecp2 3'utr.
20020497_2	thus, we confirmed that 2 gc and 293t cell lines contained the binding site for mir-212 in the 3'utr of mecp2 by end-point rt-pcr .
20020497_3	statistically significant repression of luciferase activity was observed in 293t cells cotransfected with pre-mir-212 precursor molecule and a reporter vector containing the mecp2 3'utr targetsite .
20020497_4	these results demonstrated that mir-212 did not affect mrna stability, but downregulated mecp2 expression by blocking mrna translation.
10049768_4	semiquantitative pcr suggests that the stoichiometry between smad5 and dams transcripts ranges between 15 and 120 in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells.
10049768_5	the findings raise the possibility that dams may be a fail-safe mechanism for precise regulation of smad5 transcript levels that may be critical in maintaining normal homeostasis.
21874119_1	full-length anril was shown to repress p15ink4b expression.
21874119_2	induction of p15ink4b and p16ink4a by oncogenic ras was found to repress anril expression.
24583285_1	the results showed that mir-17-92 mirna expression was significantly increased and bim was decreased in tgctwh3-infected cells.
22396777_1	western blot and luciferase assay identified bdnf as a direct target of mir-376b-5p.
22396777_2	these results suggest that bdnf is a target gene of mir-376b-5p.
22396777_3	taken together, these data prove that mir-376b-5p directly inhibits bdnf expression.
22396777_4	our western blot analysis and luciferase assay experiments demonstrated that mir-376b-5p could directly bind to bdnf gene and inhibit its expression, providing support for our hypothesis that mir-376b-5p promotes myocardial ischemia injury possibly via the downregulation of bdnf.
25477374_1	primary transcripts and mature mir-143 and mir-145 were quantified by real-time pcr, putative targets were measured by western blotting.putative
25477374_2	targets of these mirnas were assessed following transfection with mir-143 or mir-145. in agreement with increased expression of mir-143 and mir-145 in proximal colon, predicted targets of these mirnas, apoptosis inhibitor 5 , erk5, k-ras, and insulin receptor substrate 1 , which are cell cycle and survival regulators, were expressed at a lower level in proximal than distal colon.
25477374_3	transfection of hca-7 colon cancer cells with mir-145 downregulated irs-1, and transfection of ht-29 colon cancer cells with mir-143 decreased k-ras and erk5 expression. in conclusion, mir-143 and mir-145 and the predicted target proteins api5, erk5, k-ras, and irs-1 display regional differences in expression in the colon.
25472588_1	finally, we identified ezh2 as the functional downstream target of mir-32 by directly targeting the 3'utr of ezh2.
25472588_3	these data indicate that ezh2 is a direct target of mir-32 in oscc.
24345332_1	a reporter gene assay demonstrated that the binding sequences of mir-30d in the beclin 1-3'utr was the region required for the inhibition of beclin 1 expression by this mirna.
26885689_1	in the mechanistic study, we identified grb2 as a direct target of mir-329 in pancreatic cancer cells, and expression of grb2 was inversely correlated with mir-329 expression in pancreatic cancer patients.
26885689_2	figure 6: mir-329 directly targeted the 3'utr of grb2 and inhibited grb2  perk pathway.
26885689_3	these results suggest that grb2 is a major molecule targeted by mir-329, but additional mechanism is also involved.
25545366_1	taken together, our results demonstrated that mir-1470 directly recognized and bound to the 3'utr of the c-jun mrna transcript to inhibit its expression.
22854828_1	we confirmed that predicted mir-30e and -181d target sites in htra1-3'utr are critical for repression of htra1 expression by introducing point mutations that disrupt the base-pairing of both predicted target sites into rluc-htra1-3'utr construct .
22854828_2	mir-30e and mir-181d were identified as posttranscriptional negative regulators of htra1 by binding to its 3' untranslated region.
22854828_3	in vivo overexpression of mir-30e and mir-181d in dicer forebrain rescued rg proliferation defects.
25471065_1	indeed, we demonstrated that the ?p110α is a direct target of ?mir-378 in the liver, which would explain why the mice with hepatic ?mir-378 overexpression exhibited all of the hallmarks of impaired hepatic insulin signalling.
19897480_1	mir-155 could no longer decrease the luciferase activity of only the psicheck 155mut1,2-transfected cells , suggesting that mir-155 can interfere with luciferase expression via direct interaction with both mir-155 recognition sites harbored within the mecp2 3'utr.
19897480_2	collectively, these results strongly support the hypothesis that mecp2 mrna is a target of both mir-155 and -802 and suggest that these mirnas markedly decrease mecp2 expression by targeting mecp2 mrnas for degradation.
19897480_3	taken together, these results further support the premise that mecp2 mrna is a targetfor mir-155 and -802 and underexpression of mecp2 may be involved, in part, in mediating ds. as mir-155 and -802 were overexpressed in the ts65dn and human ds brain specimens, we hypothesized that mecp2 and creb1 would be underexpressed and mef2c would be overexpressed in these mice, similar to what was observed in human brain samples.
22610076_1	we further demonstrated that mir-181a and mir-181b inhibiting bcl-2, mcl-1 and x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein by direct binding to 3'utr.
22610076_2	mir-181 acts directly at the bcl-2 mcl-1 xiap-3'utr.
22610076_3	thus, mir-181a and mir-181b directly inhibit the expression of bcl-2, mcl-1 and xiap by binding to the target sequence.
20610637_1	furthermore, in mcf7 cells, overexpression of mir-214 markedly decreased lactoferrin expression , and inhibition of endogenous mir-214 expression increased lactoferrin expression and cellular apoptotic activities
26158200_1	these results indicated that mir-214 bound to the sequence present in the 3'utr of rat mpd in order to suppress the expression of mpd.
26158200_2	these results suggested that mpd mrna levels in the livers of shrsp were partially reduced by an increase in mir-214 levels.
17234972_2	overexpression experiments showed that mir-1 inhibited its in silico-predicted, growth-related targets, including ras gtpase-activating protein , cyclin-dependent kinase 9 , fibronectin, and ras homolog enriched in brain , in addition to protein synthesis and cell size.
26581909_1	we searched several databases to seek the possible downstream target genes of mir-15a-5p, including miranda and targetscan. in order to confirm the direct targeting of mir-15a-5p on bdnf gene, we carried out a dual-luciferase reporter assay.
26581909_2	it showed that mir-15a-5p significantly decreased the luciferase activity of wild type bdnf.
26581909_3	the result of western blot showed that mir-15a-5p overexpression also suppressed bdnf protein production in hepg2 and snu-182 cells.
25374061_1	the expression of endogenous ret was found to be upregulated by mir-218, and sirna-induced ret downregulation resulted in phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 upregulation and reversal of the inhibitory effect of mir-218 upregulation on hcc proliferation.
25374061_2	ret is targeted by mir-218 in hcc.
25374061_3	we also showed that ret was directly involved in the regulation of mir-218 on hcc development, possibly through pten signaling pathway.
18602365_1	mir-126 alters lung cancer cell phenotype by inhibiting adhesion, migration, and invasion and the effects on invasion may be partially mediated through crk regulation.
18602365_2	herein, we identify that crk may be a functional targetfor mir-126 in nsclc.
18602365_3	we did not observe a direct inverse correlation between mir-126 and crk in most cell lines or tissue.
2130430_1	tagln2 as a direct targetfor both mir-1 and mir-133a in rcc.
24861464_1	mir-302a and mir-4448 were markedly upregulated by treatment with saha and dznep, respectively.
24861464_2	dyrk1a, cdk2, bmi-1 and girdin, which are targets of mir-1246, mir-302a and mir-4448, were suppressed by treatment with saha and dznep, leading to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and reduced migration of ags and hepg2 cells.
20869435_1	the 3'utr sequences of bothraldh2 and rxrab contain 9- and 7-mer sites, respectively, that are complementary to 5- nucleotides of mir-143 .
20869435_2	when assayed in cos7 cells, mir-143 repressed the luciferase activities of reporters containing these utr sequences .
19839716_1	these findings establish the tumor suppressive role of mir-205, which is probably through direct targeting of oncogenes such as erbb3 and zeb1.
19839716_2	through luciferase reporter assay, western blot and immunofluorescent staining, we identified that erbb3 and vegfa are direct target of mir-205 in breast cancer cell lines.
26707142_1	taken together, our results suggest that mir-148a can suppress the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells by targeting wnt-1 and inhibiting wnt/-beta-catenin signaling pathway and this will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis.
26417068_1	using both in vitro and in vivo analyses, we identified fzd4 and lrp6 as targets of mir-19a b.
26417068_3	we demonstrate that mir-19a negatively regulates fzd4, its coreceptor lrp6, and wnt signaling, and that antagonism of mir-19a b in aged mice improves blood flow recovery after ischemia and reduces repression of these targets.
26417068_4	given that loss of the cluster increased lrp6 protein levels and that mir-19a reduced luciferase activity of the 3'utr construct in a sequence-specific manner but did not directly reduce lrp6 mrna levels, it is likely that mir-19 regulates the translational efficiency of lrp6.
26417068_5	thus, suppression of mir- 19a b activity regulates arteriogenesis and blood flow recovery, in part through enhanced fzd4 and lrp6 levels.
20010955_1	decreased mir-132 expression correlates with increased mecp2 protein, but no change in mecp2 mrna, in preconditioned mousecortex.
20010955_2	these studies validate that mir-132, an mirna known to regulate mecp2 protein expression, is decreased in preconditioned mousecortex.
26840408_1	to our knowledge, our study is the first to show that the level of nur77 is regulated by mir-124 and that nur77 has roles in proliferation of pediatric cancer cells such as daoy medulloblastoma cells.
26840408_2	we found that mir-124 was one of the 3 mirnas that substantially downregulated nur77 .
26840408_3	when we mutated the binding sites within the 3'utr corresponding to seed regions for mir-124, mir-15a, and mir-224, the mutated 3'utr became resistant to the corresponding mirna , demonstrating that these mirnas directly target nur77 by binding to a seed region within the nur77 3'utr. in this study, we found that mir-124 directly targets nur77 and that nur77 is upregulated in multiple pediatric cancer cell lines, including rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and medulloblastoma cell lines.
21112327_1	here, we show that microrna-124, a small non-coding rna down-regulated in oscc, is able to downregulate expression of integrin beta-1 by interacting with its 3' untranslated region.
21112327_2	having established that mir-124 is able to directly inhibit itgb1, we next sought to identify the sites of interaction in the itgb1 3'utr.
21112327_3	fig. 2. mir-124 downregulates itgb1 protein and mrna expression in oscc in culture.
21112327_4	over-expression of mir-124 in h357 significantly inhibited adhesion to fibronectin and reduced itgb1 expression suggesting this is a result of mir-124-mediated down-regulation of itgb1. in conclusion we have demonstrated, for the first time, the ability of mir-124 to suppress oscc invasion and migration by downregulating itgb1 expression.
21823019_1	moreover, bak1 was a direct target of mir-125b, and down-regulation of bak1 suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis and led to an increased resistance to cisplatin.
21823019_2	our study indicates that mir-125b has a significantly promoting effect on chemoresistance of c13 cells and up-regulation of mir-125b expression contributes to cisplatin resistance through suppression of bak1 expression.
21823019_3	however, no inhibitory effect of mir-125b on the activity of the reporter with the mutant 3'utr of bak1 was detected , indicating that bak1 mrna is a direct target of mir-125b.
21823019_4	fig. 3 bak1 as a direct target of mir-125b.
22439757_1	hoxa10 is a targetgene for mir-135a in breast cancer cells and overexpression of hoxa10 can partially reverse the mir-135a invasive phenotype.
22439757_2	mirna-135a promotes breast cancer cell migration and invasion by targeting hoxa10.
22439757_4	our results also suggested that mir-135a post-transcriptional down-regulation of the hoxa10 targetgene was not restricted to translation repression but also occurred by inducing mrna degradation ,4c, which agrees with previous reports on the action of mirnas and highly homologous target .
23097457_1	we found that erk-dependent latent viral gene expression, the induction of promigratory factors, and cell invasiveness followingde novoinfection of primary human endothelial cells are in part dependent on kshv suppression of dusp1 expression duringde novoinfection.kshv-encoded
23097457_2	mir-k12-11 upregulates the expression of xct , and existing data indicate a role for xct in the regulation of 14-3-3 , a transcriptional repressor of dusp1.
23826261_1	for evaluating the interaction between mir-29a and cav2 in both species, we screened the 3'utr of porcine as well as human cav2 for potential mir-29a target sites.
23826261_2	this experiment proved the interaction between human as well as porcine cav2 target sites and mir-29a to be specific.
23826261_3	furthermore, it showed that mir-29a regulation of cav2 is conserved among both species.
26202983_2	these data suggest that rnf125 is a direct target of mir-15b, and its expression is regulated by mir-15b.
26202983_3	the repressive activity of mir-15b on its target, rnf125, becomes physiologically relevant if it is able to sustain the expression of rig-i that is negatively modulated by rnf125.
26159827_1	sox2 is a putative target for mir-146a.
26159827_2	these results were confirmed by western blotting for sox 2 as well as the known mir-146a target traf6.
26159827_3	sox2 is an effective target of mir-146a.
25449696_1	we also found that fas could reverse the apoptosis-inhibition effect induced by mir-181a.
25449696_2	moreover, hbv could inhibit cell apoptosis by down-regulating fas expression, which could be reversed by mir-181a inhibitor.
25449696_3	our data demonstrated that hbv suppressed apoptosis of hepatoma cells by up-regulating mir-181a expression and down-regulating fas expression, which may provide a new understanding of the mechanism in hbv-related hcc pathogenesis.
21338882_1	here we demonstrate that the repression of olig2 in p2 domain is controlled by mir-17-3p microrna-mediated silencing of olig2 mrna.
21338882_2	thus, both strands of mir-17 might contribute to olig2 silencing through binding to mir-17-3p and mir-302b targetsites within olig2 3'utr .
21338882_3	we conclude that mir-17-3p binding sites alone are critical for mir-17 mediated silencing of olig2 3'utr.
21338882_4	together, these results provide evidence that mir-17-3p alone is sufficient to silence olig2 expression.
23591709_1	furthermore, mir-210 suppressed cell apoptosis by inhibiting caspase activity and by regulating the balance between bcl-2 and bax levels.
23591709_3	western blot analysis demonstrated that bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 protein levels decreased in cells that overexpressed mir-210 compared with controls.
26203762_1	as we have shown that scs are more radio-resistant than cb cells , the observed efficient dna repair after mir-542-5p inhibition in cb cells could either be due to the direct effects of pole1, fancl and maml1 overexpression, or the result of dedifferentiation of cb into scs .
26295043_1	figure 1: the potential target gene of mmu-mir-27a-5p, mcpip1, is upregulated in macrophage stimulated with lps. in summary, based on our previous study results, qrt-pcr was performed to validate the mrna levels of 18 inflammation-related candidate target genes, including mcpip1.
26295043_2	we, for the first time, identify mcpip1 as a target of mmu-mir-27a-5p by experimental validation and demonstrate that mmu-mir-27a-5p regulates the lps-induced upregulation of mcpip1.
22178568_1	these findings suggest that mir-124 may work as a basilic regulating factor to alleviate cell death in the process of ad by targeting bace1, play an essential role in the control of bace1 gene expression, and might be considered as a novel therapeutic targetin treating ad.
22178568_2	this finding suggested that down-regulation of mir-124 may promote the production of endogenous a through up-regulating the bace1 expression, and then further induce similar cytotoxic effects as the exogenous a insult.
22178568_3	we have predicted bace1 is one of mir-124 potential targetgenes.
21357421_1	end-point rt-pcr revealed the expression of l- and s-has2-as1 splice variants that differ only in their length of sequence complementarity with has2 and provided evidence of has2-as1 rna has2 mrna duplex formation.
21357421_3	the calculations therefore support the existence of a dimer of has2 mrna and has2-as1 rna in the absence of sequestration of the rnas in kinetic or thermodynamic traps, which were not considered by this analysis.
21357421_5	8b depict the detection of a ribonuclease- and deoxyribonuclease-resistant has2-as1 has2 heteroduplex in ptc cytoplasmic rna.
26538296_1	further study revealed that mir-221 and mir-26b promoted msc migration by targeting pten, and downstream activation of akt and fak.
26538296_2	pten is downregulated by mir-221 and mir-26b.
26538296_3	taken together, our results indicate a role for mir-221 and mir-26b in the regulation of hgf-induced msc migration through the regulation of pten and its downstream signaling molecules akt and fak .
21750348_1	such a downregulation is occurred through direct interaction of the mir-190 with the 3'utr region of the phlpp mrna, leading to a diminished phlpp protein expression and consequently, an enhanced akt activation and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, an akt-regulated protein.
21750348_2	accordingly, it is very likely that as3+-induced akt activation is achieved through the downregulation of phlpp by mir-190, leading to a sustained akt activation and an increase in cell growth and proliferation, resulting in cell transformation.
21750348_3	in contrast, the mir-190in did not show inhibition on the phlpp 3'utr reporter activity.
21750348_4	moreover, deletion of the mir-190-binding site within the phlpp 3'utr abrogated the repressive ability of the mir-190 on the reporter gene activity , demonstrating specificity of the targetsequence for phlpp.
21750348_5	thus, these data provide strong evidence suggesting that as3+-induced mir-190 is crucial for the downregulation of the phlpp protein.
23710745_1	microrna-21 reduced tnf-alpha induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis .
23710745_2	tnf-alpha downregulated the expression of microrna-21 and upregulated the mrna and protein expressions of pten.
23710745_3	phosphorylation of pten, akt and foxo3a was enhanced in cardiomyocytes transfected with lenti-microrna-21 .
23710745_5	compared with cardiomyocytes treated with tnf-alpha , the phosphorylation of pten, akt and foxo3a as well as expression of ppten, paktser473, pfoxo3a and fasl were significantly suppressed in cardiomyocytes treated with lenti-microrna-21 and tnf-alpha .
23383207_1	we identified foxf2, reck and mtss1 as potential target genes of mir-182-5p using several algorithms which was confirmed by 3'utr luciferase assay and western analysis.
23383207_3	this result suggests that the foxf2, reck and mtss1 mrnas are direct targets of mir-182-5p.
26759259_1	in addition, rna-immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays showed that igf1 3'utr was a direct target of mir-29s.
26759259_2	our data also demonstrated that there existed a competition of mir-29s between igf1-3'utr and vegf mrna, and igf1-3'utr promoted angiogenesis at least in part via sponging mir-29s.
26759259_3	taken together, our study suggests that igf1-3'utr functions as a cerna in promoting angiogenesis by sponging mir-29s in osteosarcoma.
26759259_5	because igf-3'utr shares regulatory mir-29s with vegf, we suspected that igf-3'utr could modulate vegf.
26759259_6	taken together, all these results suggest an important role of igf1-3'utr in modulating vegf by competitively binding mir-29s.
20852130_1	qrt-pcr revealed that mir-155 inhibited the expression of irakm mrna , whereas as-mir-155 enhanced it .
20852130_2	further study demonstrated that mir-155 inhibited irakm protein expression .
20852130_3	the results indicated that mir-155 suppressed renilla luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner, and that the mutation in the seed sequence of the irakm 3'utr, where mir-155 is predicted to bind bolished the suppression of renilla luciferase activity by mir-155 .
20852130_4	these results suggest that mir-155 and mir-155 function through irakm and tab2, respectively, in pdcs during tlr7 stimulation.
20173049_2	thus these results confirm the bioinformatics prediction that the 3'utr of nfatc4 is targeted by mir-133a.
20173049_3	the results showed that the cells treated with the mir-133a mimic decreased nfatc4 mrna levels 65% compared with cells treated with the control mimic .
20173049_4	this result indicates that the expression level of nfatc4 can be negatively modulated by mir-133a, and that mir-133a may be a silencer of nfactc4.
20173049_5	collectively, these data demonstrat that nfatc4 is the target of mir-133a, and that silencing of nfatc4 by mir-133a may contribute to mir-133a-mediated anti-hypertrophy.

21693595_2	furthermore, in u2os cells expressing flag-tagged h2ax cdna lacking its native 3'utr, overexpression of mir-138 could not reduce the expression of exogenous flag-h2ax , while it downregulated endogenous h2ax expression .
21693595_3	taken together, these data suggest that h2ax 3'utr is a direct target of mir-138.
21693595_4	figure 3. h2ax is a direct target of mir-138.
21693595_5	these findings suggest that mir-138 sensitizes cells to cisplatin and camptothecin mostly by downregulating h2ax.
26302266_1	all of the data indicated that rab11a was a direct target of mir-21.
26302266_2	mir-21 did not influence the mrna level of rab11a .
26302266_3	however, mir-21 mimics did inhibit the protein level of rab11a , indicating that rab11a expression may be regulated by mir-21 at the post-transcriptional level
23632416_1	the transcription factor v-ets erythroblastosis virus e26 oncogene homolog-1 was identified as a potential target of mir-222 using targetscan, and fivefold increased ets-1 protein expression in females was confirmed by western blot.

21880893_2	furthermore, as shown in figure 5, c and d, ectopic expression of mir-637 led to a decrease in osx in mrna and proteins.
21880893_3	moreover, suppression of endogenous mir-637 resulted in the up-regulation of osx in hmscs.
21880893_4	figure 5: osx was a direct target of mir-637.
21880893_5	our data confirmed that osx knockdown suppressed osteoblasts in hmscs, which was similar to the phenotypes induced by mir-637 restoration.
21880893_6	these results suggested that mir-637-induced differentiation was at least partly mediated by direct suppression of osx expression.

20071580_2	at least one kshv microrna was capable of suppressing orf50 mrna, but poor seed sequence alignments suggest that these targets may be indirect.
20071580_3	we conclude that kshv mirna targets multiple pathways to maintain the latent state of the kshv genome, including repression of the viral immediate-early protein rta and a cellular factor, rbl2, that regulates global epigenetic reprogramming.
10972807_1	the gcvb deletion mutant has high constitutive synthesis of oppa and dppa, the periplasmic-binding protein components of the two major peptide transport systems normally repressed in cells growing in rich medium.
10972807_3	although the mechanism involving gcvb in the repression of these two genes is not known, oppa regulation appears to be at the translational level, whereas dppa regulation occurs at the mrna level.
19656885_1	here we demonstrate that mir-ul112 also targets the ul114 gene, and we present evidence that the reduction of ul114 by mir-ul112 reduces its activity as uracil dna glycosylase but only minimally affects virus growth.
20851997_1	taken together with previous reports that mir-17-92 inhibits apoptosis by suppressing pten via the mir-19 components, our results indicate that this mirna cluster promotes tumorigenesis by antagonizing both tumor-suppressing mechanisms, apoptosis, and senescence, through the activities of different mirna components encoded in this cluster.

18679415_2	the repressed expression of integrin beta accompanies with reduced invasive potential of melanoma cells transfected with synthetic let-7a molecules observed in boyden chamber assays.
18679415_3	on the other hand, the induction of integrin beta expression was achieved in melanocytes by transfection with let-7a anti-mirs, resulting in invasive behavior of transfected melanocytes.
18679415_4	in summary, we determined mirna let-7a to be an important regulator of integrin beta expression and showed that the loss of let-7a expression is involved in development and progression of malignant melanoma.

22761336_1	mir-96 downregulates rev1 and rad51 to promote cellular sensitivity to cisplatin and parp inhibition.
22761336_2	mir-96 directly targeted the coding region of rad51 and the 3'-untranslated region of rev1.
22761336_3	these results suggest that endogenous levels of mir-96 downregulate rev1 and rad51 very mildly and that mir-96-mediated regulation is only one of the mechanisms that regulate rev1 and rad51 expression.
22761336_4	mir-96 is broadly conserved across many species as are the mir-96 binding sites in rad51 and rev1 transcripts , suggesting conservation of the trans-regulatory interactions between mir-96 and its target, rad51 and rev1.
26679164_1	using a luciferase-based reporter assay we found that mir-592 directly targeted the lhcgr.

21573166_3	meanwhile, the mir-29a inhibitor was able to upregulate the expression of pten at the levels of mrna and protein .
21573166_4	the data showed that the expression level of mir-29a was inversely correlated with the expression level of pten , suggesting that mir-29a negatively regulates the expression of pten by directly targeting the 3'utr of mrna.
21573166_5	as expected, we showed that the levels of pten were negatively correlated with the metastasis potential in a model of mhcc-97h cells mhcc-97l cells , suggesting that pten is negatively associated with the expression of mir-29a. it supports that pten is a target gene of mir-29a.

20618998_4	furthermore, western blot analysis showed that pten was significantly upregulated in as-mir-221 222 transfected cells. in contrast, pten expression was downregulated in pmscv-mir-221 222 infected cells .
20618998_5	together, these data demonstrated that pten is a target gene of the mir-221 222 cluster.
20618998_6	these results define an important role for pten as a mediator of the biological effects of mir-221 222 in sgc7901 gastric cancer cells.

18850008_1	to understand if the pdcd4 and pten downregulation was mediated by mir-21, we inhibited mir-21 expression, by using a chemically modified mir-21 inhibitor .
18850008_2	differing from pdcd4, pten expression was only partially inhibited by ras induction.
18850008_3	nevertheless, the partial downregulation of pten was abrogated by the antagomir-lna, thus showing that also pten is targeted by mir-21, in the ras-inducible thyroid system .
19380116_1	both kshv and ebv encode a mirna that downregulates micb, the two viral mirnas, mir-k12-7 and mir-bart2-5p, specifically downregulate micb expression to avoid attack by immune cells.
26189214_1	as predicted, the 3'utr of the mrna encoding lhx2 harbors two mir-1238 binding sites , suggesting that lhx2 could be a potential target of mir-1238.
26189214_2	as illustrated in figure 3b, mir-1238 significantly attenuated the luciferase activities in a549 and ltep-alpha-2 cells transfected with the lhx2 3'utr wildtype or mutant-1 but did not inhibit the luciferase activities in a549 and ltep-alpha-2 cells with the mutant-2 and mutant-1&2 constructs, suggesting that mir-1238 can selectively bind to the sequence of lhx2 3'utr.
26189214_3	overexpression of mir-1238 3c significantly diminished lhx2 mrna and protein levels in a549 and ltep-alpha-2 cells,taken together, the results suggested that mir-1238 can directly target the 3'utr of lhx2.
23845851_2	furthermore, we find that mir-302b can inhibit the osteosarcoma cell proliferation, promote cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest mir-302b can activate caspase-3 and regulate the akt pakt, bcl-2, bim expression to increase the cell apoptosis.

19955368_2	pre-mir-326 transfection caused substantial decreases in both notch-1 and notch-2 protein by immunoblot .
19955368_3	since mir-326 decreased protein levels of notch-1 and -2, we predicted that this mirna would be cytotoxic to gtscs.
23430263_2	screening was carried out using two different algorithms , and the results were confirmed using rna22 . in the present study, we found that both of mir-143 and mir-145 were decreased with odontoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. it is possible that klf4 and osx expression is relevant to expression of the mir-143 and mir-145 during odontoblast differentiation.
23430263_3	these data demonstrate that mir-145 binds to the 3'utr of the klf4 and osx genes, resulting in inhibition of both the two gene expression.
23430263_4	this indicates that mir-143 and mir-145 regulate the cell differentiation via klf4 and osx pathways.
23430263_5	these results indicate that mir-145 and mir-143 arrest odontoblast differentiation by down-regulating klf4 and osx expression directly and that the down-regulation of mir-145 and mir-143 during odontoblast differentiation tunes down the repression of klf4 and osx, which in turn promotes the odontoblast differentiation.
23338610_1	all these findings together support the notion that mir-23b 27b directly targets nischarin and represses its expression.
23338610_2	overexpression of nischarin inhibited migration , supporting our hypothesis that the effects of mir-23b 27b are at least in part due to the suppression of nischarin.

25405338_2	as shown in figure 6a and 6b, mir-34a mimic could reduce the expressions of nrf-2, nqo1, gst and ho-1 in the young rats after hepatic i r pretreated with nahs, suggesting that the promotion of nrf-2-mediated signaling pathway by nahs might act through down-regulation of the mir-34a level.
25405338_3	mir-34a inhibitor significantly increased the expressions of nrf-2, nqo1, gst and ho-1 in the old rats after hepatic i r injury with nahs treatment , suggesting that mir-34a-mediated nrf-2 signaling pathway is involved in hepatoprotective effects of h2s.

23285158_2	pitx3 activates the expression of different genes such as th, dat and drd2 in dopaminergic neurons and it also induces mir-133b transcription by rna polymerase ii and mirna binding to 3'utr-pitx3 , inducing mrna degradation and blocking the translation of pitx3.
23285158_3	considering the importance of mir-133b and pitx3 in the differentiation of dopaminergic neurons, we studied the cocaine-induced changes in the expression of mir-133b and pitx3 at 24 and 48 hpf by qpcr.

24987958_2	in contrast, a decrease in mir-146a by the mir-146a inhibitor elevated traf6 and irak1 expression .
24987958_3	these results imply that mir-146 is able to directly bind to traf6 or irak1 regulatory sequences in their 3'-utrs, decreasing their expression in h r-induced macrophages.

20435889_1	these results suggested that mir-221 target tnfalpha mrna for rapid decay in tolerant cells but does not regulate translation per se.
20435889_2	together, these results support that the mir-221 binding site in the tnfalpha 3'utr mediates mrna decay, whereas mir-579 and mir-125b binding sites mediate translation arrest.

23160513_3	these observations indicate that the ischemic-responsive gene mir-494 is expressed earlier than the atf3 gene and that mir-494 may function as a transcriptional regulator to atf3 after renal i r injury. in addition, as mir-494 increased, translocation levels of atf3, which reflected transcriptional activity, were decreased in the kidneys after i r .
23160513_4	together, our data suggest that mir-494 and atf3 play important pathophysiological roles in the kidneys after i r.

19850741_1	a marked reduction in the luciferase renilla ratio was seen for mcl-1, cxxc6, and cdk6 constructs transfected with synthetic mir-29b but not with the control.
19850741_2	as shown in figure 4g, cxxc6, cdk6, and mcl-1 mrna levels were lower in mir-29b-transfected samples with respect to the controls at 24 hours .
19850741_3	furthermore, the observed luciferase renilla reduction was abrogated when we cotransfected a mutated luciferase reporter vector containing the 3'utr of mcl-1, cxxc6, and cdk6 with 4 deleted nucleotides at the site of interactions with mir-29 .
19501585_2	this result indicated that mir-373 targetsite 2 of lats2-3'utr plays a more important role than mir-373 targetsite 1 in mir-373 mediating lats2 protein expression.
19501585_3	these data suggest that mir-373 specifically down-regulates lats2 at the posttranscriptional level.
25613580_2	luciferase reporter assays showed that mir-26a significantly decreased the luciferase activity of the epha2 wt 3'utr but not that of the mutant, indicating that epha2 is a direct target of mir-26a.

23541921_2	considering the facts that core tfs also directly regulate linc-ror transcription, we therefore suggested that linc-ror and core tfs formed a regulatory feedback loop in hescs.
23541921_3	these results indicate that linc-ror does not regulate oct4 at the transcriptional level but may regulate them at the posttranscriptional level.
23541921_4	these data suggest that linc-ror shares regulatory mirnas with the core tfs oct4, sox2, and nanog and that mir-145 may be one of the critical regulatory mirnas for these genes.
23541921_5	taken together, these data suggest that linc-ror functions as an mirna sponge to reduce the efficient concentration of mir-145.
23541921_6	these results indicate that linc-ror functions as an endogenous mir-145 sponge to avoid mir-145 increases in self-renewing hescs.
23541921_7	these results indicated that linc-ror deficiency results in obvious changes in the expression of mir-145 and core tfs in self-renewing hescs only after long-term culture.
23541921_8	these data are consistent with the hypothesis that linc-ror does not directly regulate mir-145 and core tf transcription but instead regulates them through posttranscriptional finetuning.

21841775_4	of the six mir-128b targets, only rcs showed a specific extinction learning-induced decrease in mrna expression, which was reflected by a time-dependent, transient decrease in rcs protein expression .
21841775_5	these observations, together with our data demonstrating a specific effect of extinction training on rcs mrna and protein expression in the ilpfc , as opposed to the general effect of learning on ppp1cc, prompted us to focus on the interaction between mir-128b and rcs, and its contribution to the formation of fear extinction memory.

19141645_3	we did not detect changes in the accumulation of either rad52 or rad23b mrna levels.
19141645_4	taken together, these findings further suggest that mir-210 and mir-373 forced expression each can cause the down-regulation of rad52 and rad23b expression, respectively, via a mechanism that target the 3'utr of these genes.

22855601_2	the identification of akt as a target of mir-378-3p led us to assess the potential influence of akt-inhibition on alternative activation by using a specific akt inhibitor, triciribine30 .
22855601_3	most likely this reflects the fact that mir-378-3p will target other, as yet-undefined target genes besides akt1 and thus have a much broader effect on the cellular phenotype, than discussed here.

22723308_1	ews fli1 regulates eya3 in ewing's sarcoma via modulation of microrna-708, resulting in increased cell survival and chemoresistance.
22723308_2	we further show that ews fli1 mediates upregulation of eya3 via repression of mir-708, a mirna that target the eya3 3'-untranslated region, rather than by binding the eya3 promoter directly.
22723308_3	together, these data suggested that the major mechanism by which eya3 is overexpressed in ewing sarcoma is via ews fli1 repression of mir-708, which target the eya3 3'utr.

21711453_3	these results indicate that mir-222 is a true regulator of ets-1 expression.
21711453_4	surprisingly, the effect induced by cotransfection of mir-221 was negligible, suggesting that the coordinated function reported for mir-221/-222 in the regulation of p27kip, c-kit and other target genes can be uncoupled.
21711453_5	as expected, tm4-derived metastases displayed a significant increase of mir-222 and a correlated decrease of p27kip compared with controls .
22768238_1	next, we demonstrated that a snp , located within the microrna-7 binding site in the 3'utr of hoxb5, could affect hoxb5 expression in bladder cancer mainly by differential binding activity of microrna-7 and snp-related mrna stability.
22768238_3	a mirna-binding snp located within 3'utr of hoxb5 is associated with gene expression and may be a promising prognostic factor for bladder cancer.

26805019_3	it is conceivable that mir-155 influences the expression of map1lc3, atg14 and ulk1 by suppression of the transcriptional factor foxo3. furthermore, we demonstrated that increased levels of mir-155 inhibit gabarapl1, atg3, atg5, atg14, foxo3, map1lc3, and ulk1 expression, and drastically suppress autophagy independently of its regulation on rictor expression and on mtor signalling.
22049153_2	on the basis of previous work indicating mir-16 to be a pleiotropic regulator of are-containing mrnas, and its ability to target reporter constructs bearing the cox-2 3'utr , we sought to determine whether mir-16 may be involved in are-mediated regulation of cox-2.
22049153_4	1a, expression of mir-16 in il-1-beta-搕reated hela cells reduced cox-2 mrna approximately 2-fold.
22049153_5	this mir-16-揹ependent loss of cox-2 mrna was reflected in a similar approximately 2-fold decrease in cox-2 protein expression and associated pge2 synthesis .
22049153_6	the ability of mir-16 to attenuate pge2 synthesis was consistent with specific targeting of cox-2 because expression of cox-1 mrna or protein were not impacted by mir-16 .
22049153_7	taken together, these results indicate that mir-16 facilitates endogenous cox-2 mrna association with risc leading to regulation of cox-2 mrna and protein overexpression.
22049153_8	these results were validated by assaying for an established target of mir-16, bcl-2, in ago2 immunoprecipitates in which mir-16 was expressed .
22049153_10	1e, bcl-2 mrna was enriched in mir-16 ago2 immunoprecipitates, whereas capture of the negative control gapdh mrna was unchanged.

22049153_13	2d, overexpression of mir-16 had no effect on cox-2 promoter or control sv40 promoter enhancer activity, indicating mir-16 targeting of cox-2 is 3'utr dependent and not a consequence of indirect transcriptional interference.
22049153_14	these results substantiate that targeted downregulation of cox-2 by mir-16 occurs via the 3'utr to promote enhanced mrna degradation.

26058485_3	the expression of pak6 was positive in colon cancer tissues, but negative in their matched adjacent normal tissues, suggesting that pak6 acts as an oncogene in colon cancer.taken

26631117_1	luciferase reporter and western blot assays showed that il-10ralpha expression is directly regulated by mir-15a, mir-185, and mir-211, either alone or in combination.

26455824_3	therefore, these results demonstrate that ddah1 is a direct target of mir-21.
21200031_2	to examine the possibility of mir-125b targeting igf-ii, we asked whether mir-125b regulated igf-ii expression.
21200031_3	both mrna and protein levels of igf-ii increased during c2c12 differentiation as previously reported , which correlated well with the drop of mir-125b levels at the same time .
21200031_4	the efficacy of delivering oligonucleotides into muscles might not be optimal , but the observed effects are significant and fully consistent with mir-125b targeting igf-ii during muscle regeneration in vivo.
21200031_5	most importantly, when the predicted mir-125b seed region in the 3'utr was mutated, the mutant reporter no longer responded to mir-125b , strongly suggesting that the predicted site is a bona fide target of mir-125b and it is solely responsible for mir-125b targeting of the igf2 3'utr.
21200031_6	these results suggest that mir-150 is unlikely to regulate igf2, and they also serve as negative controls that validate the reporter assays , identifying mir-125b as a bona fide igf2 regulator.
21200031_7	although our observations do not definitively eliminate the possibility of other mirnas and or target sites being involved in regulating igf2 3'utr, collectively they strongly support the notion that mir-125b plays a predominant role in the regulation of igf-ii during skeletal myogenesis.

24205079_1	mirna-132 and mirna-214 suppress srebp-1c and ldlr by targeting specific site within the 3'utr of srebp-1c and ldlr, respectively.
24205079_2	overexpression of pre-mirna-132 and pre-mirna-214 significantly decreased the luciferase activity of the 3'utr of the srebp-1c and ldlr reporter containing micrna-132 and mirna-214 binding sites, respectively.
25272045_1	these data suggest that mir-410, mir-495, and mir-214 specifically inhibit the fhl1 3'utr, but that the effects of mir-146a and mir-146b-5p may be non-specific or at sites other than their predicted target sites.
25272045_2	interestingly, fhl1 mrna expression also was decreased by mir-410, but not mir-495 or mir-214 .
25272045_3	these results suggest that mir-495 and mir-214 inhibit fhl1 at the protein level, but that mir-410 functions to inhibit mir-410 via a mechanism that occurs prior to fhl1 translation.
22941339_1	our previous findings suggested that upregulation of hsa-mir-127 in ebv-positive bl may determine the downregulation of blimp-1 and xbp-1 and the consequent persistence of bcl-6 expression, as well as the gc phenotype in b cells that have already differentiated towards memory b cells in terms of ig mutation pattern.
23716467_1	the transfection of mir-17-5p mimics or sirna-p21 reversed the effect of bortezomib on htb-111 and ishikawa cells, indicating that mir-17-5p may mediate the function of bortezomib by targeting p21 in endometrial cancer cells.

19370765_2	we have found the c allele of rs28521337, located in a functional target site for mir-485-3p in the truncated isoform of ntrk3, to be significantly associated with the hoarding phenotype of ocd.
19370765_3	we have also identified two new rare variants in the 3'utr of ntrk3, ss102661458 and ss102661460, each present only in one chromosome of a patient with pd. the ss102661458 variant is located in a functional target site for mir-765, and the ss102661460 in functional target sites for two mirnas, mir-509 and mir-128, the latter being a brain-enriched mirna involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptic processing.
19370765_5	these data implicate mirnas as key posttranscriptional regulators of ntrk3 and provide a framework for allele-specific mirna regulation of ntrk3 in anxiety disorders.
23547260_1	mir-33a specifically target the 3'utr of human npc1, crot, irs2, src1, src3, and nyfc, while mir-33b specifically target the 3'utr of human nfyc.
23547260_2	here, we identify seven mir-33a and two mir-33b targetgenes and show that mir-33a and mir-33b overexpression leads to their posttranscriptional repression.
18632605_2	in contrast, pgl3 carrying the mutant 3'utr of hif-1alpha with 4-bp deletions in the core of seed sequences of each targetsite for mir-17-5p and mir-20a did not show obvious decreases in luciferase activities when transfected into clones #31 and #57.
18632605_3	we also analyzed whether such negative regulation of hif-1alpha could be indirectly provoked by hypoxia-induced up-regulation by mir-17-92.
18632605_4	transient transfection of c-myc clearly led to up-regulation of mir-20a and down-regulation of hif-1alpha in beas2b cells. in conclusion, we identified hif-1alpha as a novel targetfor mir-17-92 using itraq tagging and multidimensional lc and ms ms analyses.
18632605_5	transient transfection of c-myc clearly led to up-regulation of mir-20a and down-regulation of hif-1a in beas2b cells. in this study, we identified hypoxia-inducible factor -1alpha as a novel direct targetfor mir-17-92 through global expression profiling by mass spectrometric analysis using an isobaric tagging reagent, itraq, combined with bioinformatic targetprediction.
22431718_1	luciferase reporter assay further verified direct target association of mir-145 to specific sites of the irs1 and irs2 3'-untranslated regions.
22431718_2	here, we describe recurrent underexpression of mir-145 in hepatocellular carcinoma and the identification of a biological pathway by which mir-145 exerts its functional effects in liver tumorigenesis. it is therefore probable that mir-145 inhibits hcc cell proliferation along the igf pathway, at least in part through simultaneous targeting of irs1 and irs2, and an indirect influence on igf1r expression.
26150475_1	there was a significant negative correlation between the relative levels of mir-21 and pdcd4 mrna in malignant melanoma tissues, as shown by spearman-rank correlation coefficient analysis.
26150475_2	as shown in table 1, an elevated mir-21 relative level and reduced pdcd4 mrna relative level were both significantly correlated with an increased tumour size, a higher clark classification level and the presence of lymph node metastases in malignant melanoma.

21501375_1	at 104 weeks of age, hf-prone mice had significantly reduced expression levels of mir-17, mir-18a, mir-19a, mir-19b, mir-20a, and mir-92a-1 as compared to 12-week littermates , coinciding with the observed increased presence of their targets tsp-1 and ctgf.
21501375_2	aging of hf-resistant mice, on the other hand, was accompanied by significantly enhanced expression of these mirnas, except for mir-17 and mir-20a .
21501375_3	together, these data suggest that regulation of ctgf and tsp-1 is the result of the shared expression of mir-18a, mir-19a, and mir19b, enabling modest changes in mirna expression to control transcriptional repression.
21501375_4	these findings confirm the expression profiles in aged hf-prone mice and again suggest that mir-18a, mir-19a, and mir-19b could transcriptionally repress ctgf and tsp-1 levels in cardiomyocyte aging and hf at old age.
21501375_5	these results show that regulation of ctgf and tsp-1 by mir-18a and mir-19b is uniquely restricted to the cardiomyocyte.
21501375_6	thus, in concordance with ctgf and tsp-1 regulation by mir-18a and mir-19b in cardiomyocytes, these data strongly imply that mir-18a and mir-19b contribute to the induction of collagen synthesis in aged cardiomyocytes via the regulation of the pro-fibrotic ctgf and tsp-1.
19931509_1	over-expression of mir-200a significantly downregulated, whereas knock-down of mir-200a upregulated, the protein expressions of both zeb2 and ctnnb1.

23152446_4	our findings-initially from functionally screening a whole-genome mir library-that let-7 and mir-18 target acvr1b and smad2 to control mesoderm at the expense of endoderm reveal an unanticipated and evolutionarily conserved role for mirs that is nonredundant with known regulators of germ layer specification.

11251852_1	at least two small rnas, dsra and rpra , participate in the positive regulation of rpos translation.
11251852_2	unlike dsra, rpra does not have an extensive region of complementarity to the rpos leader.it is dsra but not rpra which is important for minimal medium expression of rpos.mutations in the gene interfere with the induction of rpos after osmotic shock when dsra is absent, demonstrating a physiological role for rpra.
26868851_1	the above results demonstrated that igf-1 r, amy-1, and pgc-1b were primary targets of mir-139 in regulating the activity of glioma cells.
20827722_1	further studies revealed that lin28b was a downstream target of mir-125b in hcc cells as mir-125b bound directly to the 3' untranslated region of lin28b, thus reducing both the messenger rna and protein levels of lin28b.
20827722_2	lin28b was a direct downstream targetfor mir-125b in hcc cells.
20827722_3	the expression level of lin28b mrna was down-regulated by mir-125b using real-time pcr assays.
20827722_4	taken together, these findings indicate that lin28b is a direct downstream targetfor mir-125b in hcc cells.
20827722_5	together, our results indicate that reduction of lin28b through sirna interference has similar effects on the hcc cells to those induced by mir-125b, suggesting that lin28b may act as a downstream functional mediator for mir-125b.
20827722_6	taken together, these findings show that lin28b reintroduction could abrogate mir-125b-搃nduced cell growth arrest and metastasis suppression, suggesting that lin28b is a functional mediator for mir-125b in hcc cells.
21530489_1	in the current study, our data demonstrated that ifn-gamma stimulation and fas activation suppressed dicer processing and let-7 microrna biogenesis, while let-7 microrna strongly inhibited fas expression by directly targeting fas mrna.

21447182_1	transfection experiments showed that bovine npm2 protein expression is reduced in hela cells expressing mir-181a compared to control cells without mir-181a, indicating that translation of npm2 is repressed by mir-181a.
21447182_2	a mir-181a binding site in bovine npm2 3'utr was identified .
21447182_3	the inverse correlation between mir-181a and npm2 expression during early embryogenesis further supports our hypothesis that npm2 might be down-regulated by mir-181a.
21447182_4	quantification of npm2 protein expression using densitometry confirmed that co-expression with mir-181a decreased the level of npm2 protein , indicating that translation of npm2 is repressed by mir-181a.

25204970_2	taken together, mir-338 might inhibit growth and metastasis of oscc cells by targeting nrp1.
25204970_3	finally, we further identified neuropilin1 as a direct target of mir-338 in oscc cells. in addition, we identified that nrp1 was a direct target of mir-338 in oscc cells.
20486857_2	in addition, anti-mir-98 and anti-let-7i markedly increased socs4 3'utr-associated luciferase reporter translation .
20486857_3	in contrast, mir-98 and let-7i precursors significantly decreased the luciferase activity .
20486857_4	the above data suggest that mir-98 and let-7 targetsocs4 3'utr resulting in posttranscriptional suppression.
20486857_5	taken together, the above data suggest that c. parvum infection decreases expression of mir-98- and let-7 through activation of the tlr4 myd88 signaling pathway to regulate socs4 protein expression in biliary epithelial cells.
26845057_1	we analyzed the 3'utr of mfn2 using the target scan program and found apreferred candidate mirna, mir-761, that targets three puta-tive binding sites within the 3'utr of mfn2.
26845057_2	we mutated the three candidate binding sites andfound that the wild-type 3'utr of mfn2 exhibited a lowertranslation level in the presence of mir-761, whereas themutated 3'utr did not show a significant response to mir-761 .
26845057_3	taken together,these results indicate that mfn2 is a direct target of mir-761in hcc cells and that mir-761 downregulates mfn2 expres-sion by directly targeting its 3'utr.
20644734_2	mir-148 was shown to affect mitf mrna expression in melanoma cellsthrough a conserved binding site in the 3'utr sequence of mouse and human mitf.in
20644734_3	addition we confirm the previously reported effects of mir-137 on mitf.
20644734_4	these results indicate that mir-148 is able to downregulate mitf expression by binding to the 148 152b binding site.
20644734_6	our results therefore confirm the role of mir-137 in regulating mitf expression.
20644734_7	these results show that the mir-137 and mir-148 have the same effects on expression of the endogenous mitf gene as seen using the luciferase reporter assay.
20644734_8	when the cells were transfected with either mir-137, mir-148 or simultaneously with both mir-137 and mir-148, mitf protein levels were reduced.
26893028_1	in addition, we demonstrated that pten was the direct target of mir-92b and reduce of pten expression partially rescued the inhibitory effects of mir-92b inhibitor on the glioma cells.
26893028_2	taking together, these data showed that the mir-92b could bind to pten 3'utr and mir-92b is able to downregulate the activity of pi3k akt signal pathway.
26893028_3	these results implied that the mir-92b directly targets pten who further suppresses pi3k akt signaling pathway in glioma cells.
25451224_1	mir-25 also increased cell viability, decreased early apoptosis, and downregulated the accumulation of mutant ataxin-3 protein aggregates in sca3 mjd cells.

26562549_2	no appreciable inhibitory effect was observed when mir-1290 mimics or nc mimics co-transfected with the empty vector or the mutant reporter , indicate that the gsk3-beta is a direct target of mir-1290.
21890451_1	we then determined that the tumor suppressor dicer1 is a target of hsa-mir-31.
21890451_2	the immunoblot and reporter assays independently confirmed that dicer1 is a target of hsa-mir-31 in human cells.
21890451_3	interestingly, quantification of dicer1 mrna indicated a certain downregulation of the level of dicer1 mrna expression in sk-mes-1 cells transfected with hsa-mir-31 as compared with control microrna, even though the p value is not significant, suggesting that hsa-mir-31 may act mainly by inhibiting the translation of dicer1 .
21890451_4	these results indicated that the expression of dicer1 is inversely correlated with hsa-mir-31 level in scc tumor tissues.
21890451_5	we showed that hsa-mir-31 directly target the dicer1 3'utr and repressed the expression of dicer1 but not ppp2r2a or lats2.
20382729_1	to determine whether fli-1 could be directly targeted by mirna145, we engineered the pgl3 luciferase reporter vector to contain either the human wild-type full-length human fli-1 3'utr or its mutant form harboring a 6-base deletion in the four putative mirna145 targetsites . in hek293 cells, cotransfection of the luciferase reporters with a retroviral vector expressing the mirna145 resulted in a 60% reduction in luciferase expression from the wild-type fli-1 3'utr reporter.
19070389_1	the exogenous expression of mir-320 or mir-204 could negatively regulate mcl-1 or bcl-2 expression and facilitate chemotherapeutic drug-triggered apoptosis.
22246100_1	our findings attribute stress-inducible cognitive impairments to cholinergic-mediated induction of mir-132 and consequently suppressed ache-s, opening venues for intercepting these mir-132-mediated damages.
22246100_2	therefore, if ache-s suppression could by itself prevent stress-inducible cognitive decline, tgr mice should show no such decline; but if mir-132 increases are the cause, then these mice should present a stress phenotype.
22246100_3	neuronal ache and the gtpase activator p250gap are both targets of mir-132.
22246100_4	these findings are compatible with the hypothesis that the inter-individual variability in hippocampal mir-132 is inversely interlocked with that of p250gap.
22246100_5	our analysis thus attributes the observed stress-inducible cholinergic hyper-excitation to the feed-forward regulation of mir-132 and ache transcripts, and shows that avoiding p250gap reduction and the corresponding breadth of inter-individual variability in mir-132 associates with stress-inducible cholinergic hyper excitation and cognitive impairments .

26191168_3	co-transfection of mir-26b mimics suppressed the luciferase activity of the reporter containing wild-type epha2 3'utr sequence, but failed to inhibit that of mutated epha2 by dual-luciferase reporter assay.
26191168_4	inversely, luciferase activity was significantly increased in the cells transfected with mir-26b inhibitors, but did not change in the mut 3'utr cells .
26191168_5	these data suggest that epha2 may be a direct functional target of mir-26b in hcc.
12719555_1	we speculate that tmevpg1 may down-regulate the expression of ifng because both genes are expressed in the same subset of lymphocytes , they have opposite expression patterns following stimulation, and the tmevpg1 gene and its human ortholog encode a noncoding rna.
12719555_3	furthermore, the pattern of expression of tmevpg1 during stimulation is a mirror image of that of ifng.

20080666_1	reporter assays in which the pten, rb1, or map3k2 3'-utrs were fused to gfp or luciferase conifirmed that the 3'-utrs of these mrnas confer regulation by mir-26a .in

26799422_1	linc00152 expression was inversely correlated with p15 and p21 mrna and protein levels.
26799422_2	linc00152 knockdown markedly increased levels of p15 and p21 in xenograft tumors .
26799422_3	these data suggest that linc00152 contributes to gc development by inhibiting p15 and p21.

25472877_1	ccng1 and mef2d, two putative mir-122 targets, were found to be downregulated by oa treatment.
26349988_1	we examined several putative mir-101 target genes identified by microarray analysis and demonstrated that mir-101 directly targets cxcl12, which play important roles in cafs.
26349988_2	the mutant construct exhibited a lower inhibitory effect on luciferase activity compared with the cxcl12 3'utr vector after mir-101 cotransfection , suggesting that mir-101 suppressed the transcription activity of the cxcl12 gene bytargetingthe bindingsite in the 3'utr of cxcl12 mrna independently.
26349988_3	collectively, these findings suggest that mir-101 regulates the expression of cxcl12 post-transcriptionally.
18483394_1	in the present studies, we have confirmed, as predicted, that mir-16-1 regulates ccnd1 protein expression and that truncation of the 3'utr occurs in mcl cell lines preventing proper mir-16-1 regulation of ccnd1.
18483394_2	to prove that this truncation alters both mir-16-1 binding sites within the ccnd1 mrna, we cloned the truncated version from all 4 mcl cell lines.
18483394_3	this truncation occurs 328 bp immediately downstream of the stop codon and eliminates 2863 bp of the distal ccnd1 3'utr including both mir-16-1 binding sites .
18483394_4	these data are consistent with the hypothesis that truncated ccnd1 3'utr is unresponsive to regulation by mir-16-1.
22235305_1	using a recently established model in which apoptosis of ctcl cell lines is induced by notch-1 inhibition by 纬-secretase inhibitors , we found that mir-122 was significantly increased in the apoptotic cells.
22235305_3	surprisingly,mir-122 overexpression decreased the sensitivity to the chemotherapy-induced apoptosis via a signaling circuit involving the activation of akt and inhibition of p53.
25154741_1	furthermore, we identified and validated matrix metalloproteinase-2 as a direct target of mir-130b.
25154741_2	taken together, our data reveal for the first time that mir-130b exerts a suppressive effect in prostate cancer metastasis through down-regulation of mmp2. the effects of mir-130b on tumor metastasis could be attributed to the decreased expression of mmp2, which has been identified as a new target for mir-130b.
25154741_3	thesefindings indicate that mir-130b negatively regulates mmp2 expression by directly binding to its 3 0 -utr.
22265691_2	the results indicate that overexpression of mir-18a leads to a 29% decrease in ptf1a mrna levels and a 62% decrease in ptf1a protein levels relative to controls, while inhibition of mir-18a partially rescues the expression of ptf1a protein .

23142218_3	these results suggest that mir-24 represses st7l expression through the predicted targeting sites in the st7l 3'utr.
23142218_4	these results suggest that the carcinogenesis effects of mir-24 are in part facilitated by st7l downregulation.
23142218_5	taken together, these data suggest that mir-24 regulates b-catenin tcf-4 transcriptional activities via st7l, at least in u87 and ln229 cells.

22847819_5	mitf protein levels were significantly reduced by 0.5-fold below the control group , suggesting a strong translational repression of mitf was induced by the overexpressed mir-137.
26459797_1	luciferase assay revealed that mir-33b bound to zeb1 3'utr region and inhibited zeb1 expression, while expression of zeb1 mrna and mir-33b was inversely associated with lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and tissues.
26459797_2	taken altogether, our data indicate that mir-33b targets zeb1 expression by binding to zeb1 3'utr region to modulate proliferation, migration and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma cells.
26459797_3	indeed, our current data showed that: i the expression of mir-33b and zeb1 was inversely correlated in lung adenocarcinoma cells and tissues; ii mir-33b bound to zeb1 3'utr region;
18319255_1	mir-224, which is up-regulated in the tumors of hcc patients, sensitizes cells to apoptosis through r nthe inhibition of api-5 at the mrna levels and increases cell proliferation.
18319255_2	significantly, mir-224 expression was found to be inversely correlated with api-5 expression in hcc patients.
19435871_2	low or absent mir-200c results in aberrant expression of zeb1 and consequent repression of e-cadherin.
19435871_3	reinstatement of mir-200c to such cells restores e-cadherin and dramatically reduces migration and invasion.
19435871_4	microarray profiling reveals that in addition to zeb1 and zeb2, other mesenchymal genes , which are also predicted direct targets of mir-200c, are indeed inhibited by addition of exogenous mir-200c.
19435871_5	one such gene, class iii beta-tubulin , which encodes a tubulin isotype normally found only in neuronal cells, is a direct target of mir-200c.
19435871_7	because expression of tubb3 is a common mechanism of resistance to microtubule-binding chemotherapeutic agents in many types of solid tumors, the ability of mir-200c to restore chemosensitivity to such agents may be explained by its ability to reduce tubb3.
23108995_1	as expected, this suppression was abolished by deleting part of the perfectly complementary sequences in the rb1 3'utr which disrupts the interaction between mir-26a and rb1 .
23108995_2	further, we identified that rb1 is the direct functional target of mir-26a, and revealed that the reduction of mir-26a expression leads to increased rb1 protein level and thus inhibits the function of e2f1, by which it influences the phenotypes of cell cycle and anoikis.
23108995_3	rb1 is a direct functional target of mir-26a in ea cells.
19767219_3	mirna-221 silencing predisposed t24 cells to undergo apoptosis induced by trail and resulted in an up-modulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1.

23337879_3	together, these data suggest that bcl2l2 is indeed a direct targetgene of mir-214.
23337879_6	2c and d, bcl2l2 mrna and protein levels were both inhibited in hela mir-214 cells, indicating mir-214 can negatively regulate the expression of bcl2l2 at the post-transcriptional level.
21081489_1	ets-1 is a novel target of mir-200b.
21081489_2	mir-200b is involved in induction of angiogenesis via directly targeting ets-1 in hmecs.
21081489_3	as expected, deletion of the ets-1 3'utr sequence from the construct abolished the inhibitory effects of mir-200b on luciferase activity .
21081489_4	these results establish that mir-200b interact with the ets-1 3'utr to exert translational repression.
22850877_1	reporter assays were carried out to determine whether mir-34a binds directly to these 3'-utrs as well as those of other predicted mir-34a target genes identified in our analysis that are not directly involved in rho gtpase regulation, but are potentially important in tumorigenesis .
22850877_2	arhgap1 reconstitution repressed basal gtp-bound cdc42 and rescued tgf--beta-搃nduced sphere invasion in matrigel , which suggests that mir-34a represses tgf--beta-搃nduced tumor cell invasion by downregulating arhgap1.

25351256_3	transfection with mir-429 mimics significantly reduced the endogenous p27kip1 mrna and protein expression levels in if11 and ia8 cells . in conclusion, these data suggest that p27kip1 is a direct target gene of mir-429.
26676658_1	upregulation of mir-215 notably inhibited the expression of xiap. in conclusion, we identified mir-215 as a potential tumor suppressor in patients with eoc downregulating expression of the oncogenic regulator xiap.
21970405_1	as shown in figure figure5e,5e, mir-125b significantly decreased the relative luciferase activity of wild-type tp53inp1 3'utr , whereas the reduction of the luciferase activity with mutant tp53inp1 3'utr was not as sharp as that observed in the wild-type counterpart, suggesting that mir-125b could directly bind to the 3'utr of tp53inp1.
21970405_2	taken together, these findings indicate that tp53inp1 is a direct downstream target for mir-125b in ec cells.
26443314_1	the mir-210 mimic effectively reduced rod1 expression as detected by western blot analysis, whereas the mir-210 inhibitor led to an increase in rod1 expression . .
26443314_2	this data indicates that rod1 is probably a target of mir-210 in gbm cells.
21095586_1	to assess the precise contribution of each mirna-binding site, we mutated the predicted mir-35-42 and bantam-binding sites within the toh-1, and egl-1 3'-utrs and examined their effects on deadenylation, and translation repression assays .
21095586_2	for reporters containing thetoh-1 3'utr , mutating either the mir-35-42 or the bantam site alone effectively impaired deadenylation , wereas no deadenylation could be detected when using the double mutant 3'utr .
21095586_3	while these data cannot rule out a weak and residual activity for the mir-35-42 site on its own, they indicate that the mir-35-42 and the cebantam mirna families cooperate synergistically in promoting the deadenylation and silencing on the toh-1 3'utr. in similar reporter assays, the 3'utr of the egl-1 mrna also mediated a potent translation repression, and a rapid deadenylation .
21095586_4	mutation of the mir-35-42 binding site on its own, or in combination with an additional mutation in the predicted bantam site at position 86, completely abrogated reporter deadenylation and translation repression .

20488920_2	after treatment of panc1 and l3.6pl cells with cddo-me, there was a decrease in expression of mir-27a , and this was accompanied by increased zbtb10 mrna levels .
20488920_3	this demonstrates that cddo-me-induced ros is a common upstream factor regulating disruption of mir-27a:zbtb10-揝p axis.
19502795_1	we focused on human -mir-124a that has a predicted binding site in the 3'utr of the ikappab mrna.
19502795_2	based on these structural features it is likely that ikappab is targeted by mir-124a.
19502795_3	although detailed functional studies are required to investigate these possibilities, our results suggest that mir-124a-controlled downregulation of ikappab is involved in the regulation of nfkappa activity.
24444604_1	mir-455 is negatively regulated in mir-155-deficient cells possibly due to inhibition of the transcription factor c ebpbeta by mir-155.
17575136_1	the authors conclude that, in addition to mir-106a, mir-20b, mir-19b-2, and mir-92-2 overexpression in tumors, their capacity to induce anchorage independence growth strongly supports an oncogenicpotential for those mirnas.
17575136_2	they also conclude that mylip and rbp1-like are true targets of the mir-106-363 cluster .
17575136_3	more specifically, rbp1-like seemed only targeted by mir-106a mir-20b, whereas mylip could be targeted by the four mirnas with mir-106a mir-20b being more efficient.
25032870_1	mef2c is a direct target gene of mir-203 that has a positive role in myoblast differentiation.
25032870_2	the protein expression of mef2c was down-regulated during e14 and e16 , and it was upregulated from proliferation to differentiation of myoblasts , demonstrating that mef2c expression correlated with mir-203 levels in vitro and in vivo.
25032870_3	thus, mef2c is a target of mir-203, and its knockdown significantly represses the late stage of myoblast differentiation.
25032870_4	mef2c, a new target of mir-203 found in this study, is upregulated during c2c12 differentiation, 53 and its interaction with maml1, notch3 and the p38 mapk pathway is required for normal myogenesis .

18193036_2	mechanistically, the migration phenotype of mir-373 and mir-520c can be explained by suppression of cd44.
18193036_3	we found significant upregulation of mir-373 in clinical breast cancer metastasis samples that correlated inversely with cd44 expression.
26733177_2	these results suggest that the mechanism by which mir-145 promotes tnf-alpha-induced apoptosis is dependent on the downregulation of ciap1 in tnbc cells.
26733177_3	collectively, our study found that mir-145-induced ciap1 degradation facilitated tnf-alpha-induced apoptosis in tnbc.
21482222_1	in this study, we demonstrated that microrna-142-3p acted as a negative regulator of human rac1.
21482222_3	furthermore, to determine if mir-142-3p suppressed endogenous rac1 through translational repression, rac1 protein levels were detected by western blot analysis.
21482222_4	in qgy-7703 cells transfected with pcdna3 pri-mir-142-3p, the mature mir-142-3p level was significantly increased , and the rac1 mrna and protein levels were significantly reduced .
21482222_5	these data suggested that mir-142-3p negatively regulates endogenous rac1 protein expression through mrna degradation and translational repression.

19830559_4	mir-141 and sip1 might be candidate therapeutic targets in crc.
25118937_1	we further show that mir-940 directly binds to the 3'-untranslated regions of nestin mrna and promotes its degradation.
25118937_3	these functions of mir-940 can be reversed by ectopic expression of nestin, suggesting that mir-940 regulates cell proliferation and survival through nestin.
22159356_1	we further demonstrate that mirna-205 can specifically suppress expression of vegf-a by directly interacting with the putative mirna-205 binding site at the 3'utr.
22159356_2	herein, we found that the expression of vegf-a was significantly elevated with the ascending order of glioma grade , accompanying the decrease of mirna-205 .
22159356_3	these results indicate that mirna-205 directly modulate vegf-a expression by binding 3'utr of vegf-a in glioma cells.
26426440_3	similarly, expression of hox9, spx and ta.42302 gradually increased from 14 to 28 dpa , accompanied by down-regulation of mir166, mir827 and ta-mirn8 expression .
26426440_6	by comparing the expression of mir164 and its validated targets, nac and psk1 , we found that the negative correlation with mir164 was more evident for psk1 than nac , inferring that psk1 might be a major target of mir164 in grain development.

21859927_1	protein expression of p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis , a potential target of mir-483-3p, was significantly decreased in acc, and inversely correlated with mir-483-3p expression.
21258340_1	we find that mir-430 regulates sdf1a and cxcr7 mrnas.
21258340_2	these results indicate that the ligand and the decoy receptors cxcr7a b are more strongly regulated by mir-430 than cxcr4a b and sdf1b .
21258340_3	three lines of evidence indicate that tps interfere with the regulation of sdf1a and cxcr7 by mir-430.
21258340_4	these results suggest that mir-430 regulation of endogenous sdf1a and cxcr7b plays a role in pgc migration.
21258340_5	thus, mir-430 is required to modulate the amount of sdf1a rna and to shape its expression pattern by clearing transcripts from old expression domains.
21258340_6	these results indicate that mir-430 and cxcr7b act together to modulate sdf1a mrna expression and protein levels, respectively.
26617737_1	however, the high level of mir-135b was associated with increased expression of foxo1 in cervical cancer cells.

26711789_1	further, functional analyses showed that snp rs7213430 is within the mir-101 seed-binding region, and the variant g allele could lead to significantly lower luciferase activity and brip1 mrna expression, compared to the a allele with the presence of mir-101.
26711789_2	our results suggested that snp rs7213430 in the 3'utr of brip1 might contribute to scchn susceptibility by affecting the binding activity of mir-101 and resulting in a decreased brip1 expression.
21191961_1	transfection of hacat cells with pre-mir-21 significantly suppressed a luciferase reporter including the cdk2ap1-3'utr, whereas transfection of tca8113 with anti-mir-21 increased activity of this reporter.

21297634_1	we demonstrate that lin-28 bindsdogenous primary let-7 transcripts co-transcriptionally. the correlation between decreased pri-let-7 levels and increased pre- and mature let-7 levels in lin-28 mutant worms suggests that lin-28 normally functions to block primary to precursor let-7 processing during development in c. elegans.
13130513_1	psza11q14 is located within the first intron of the dlg-2 gene and transcribed in the opposite direction to dlg-2.
13130513_2	these results suggest that psza11q14 may be considered a candidate gene for schizophrenia acting as an antisense regulator of dlg-2.
21419107_1	we also found that mir-10b induced glioma cell invasion by modulating tumor invasion factors mmp-14 and upar expression via the direct targethoxd10.
26229009_1	since mir-214 exerts inhibitory actions on the ccn2 3'utr , these results suggested that twist1 transcriptionally activates mir-214 which then acts to suppress ccn2 mrna levels.
26229009_2	transfection of the cells with twist1 resulted in reduced ccn2 mrna expression or protein production but this was reversed by co-transfection of the cells with a mir-214 antagomir showing that ccn2 inhibition by twist1 is indirect and mediated through mir-214.
19419954_4	we show that mir-21 is upregulated via the mapk pathway upon stimulation of her2 neu signaling in breast cancer cells, and over-expression of other erk1 2 activators such as rasv12 or id-1 is sufficient to induce mir-21 up regulation in her2 neu negative breast cancer cells.
23224365_1	this elevated expression results in increased ifn-alpha1 mrna stability because of the cytoplasmic interaction of the as rna with the mrna at the single-stranded region.
23224365_5	these data thus indicate that mir-1270 and ifn-alpha1 as rna may compete for binding to ifn-alpha1 mrna.
19530237_1	we found evidence that hsa-mir-127 is involved in b-cell differentiation process through posttranscriptional regulation of blimp1 and xbp1.
22729175_1	in conclusion, the combined use of bioinformatic prediction tools, deep sequencing and qrt-pcr analyses identified a gradient of mir-7a opposing the expression of pax6 protein in the neurogenic compartment of the postnatal and adult svz.
22729175_2	hus, repression of pax6 by mir-7a in the lateral wall is necessary to control the rate of dopaminergic neuron production in the olfactory bulb .
22729175_3	figure 5 mir-7a controls pax6 expression through its 3'utr in vivo.
22729175_4	these results suggest that mir-7a binding to the pax6 3'utr is sufficient to downregulate pax6 protein along the lateral ventricle in vivo.
26111928_1	cx43 and bdnf are well known targets of mir-1.
26111928_2	we therefore analyzed the protein expression of cx43 and bdnf in sciatic nerves and drg.
23435381_2	in contrast, suppression of the ptenpg1 lncrna released mirnas, which instead led to destabilization of pten.
22095742_1	using quantitative real-time rt-pcr, we found that mir-17-92 expressed in pmcs and decreased from embryonic day 12 to e14 in palatal shelves.
22095742_2	mtt assay and western blot showed that mir-17-92 inhibited tgfb1 induced proliferation inhibition and collagen synthesis in pmcs by decreasing tgfbr2, smad2, and smad4 protein level.
22095742_3	further luciferase assay showed that mir-17 and mir-20a directly targeted 3'utr of tgfbr2, and that mir-18a directly targeted 3'utr of smad2 and smad4.
22095742_4	these results indicate that mir-17 and mir-20a might targettgfbr2, and that mir-18a might targetsmad2 and smad4 in pmcs.

26395571_2	on the basis of these data, we propose that mir-200 down-regulates bmp4 through direct targeting of its transcription factors, gata4 and gata6.
24000294_2	we further discovered that hnf1a-as1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, suppressed s-phase entry, and inhibited cell migration and invasion in multiple in vitro eac models .

26364720_3	these data indicate that malat1 protects endothelial cells partly via competing with mir-22-3p, which results in the upregulation of cxcr2.
23100276_1	ectopic expression of mir-214 reduced cell growth and induced apoptosis of myeloma cells.mir-214

25034767_2	we found that luciferase activity was decreased after microinjection of pgl3-promoter ctnnb1 3'utr and mir-19b mimic compared with microinjection of pgl3-promoter ctnnb1 3'utr , indicating that mir-19b directly targets ctnnb1.
25034767_3	we measured the expression level of ctnnb1 using qpcr and in situ hybridization and confirmed that the expression level of ctnnb1 is negatively correlated with mir-19b expression .

20395292_3	a corresponding slight down-regulation of app mrna was observed , suggesting that although mir-101 may act primarily by reducing app translation it may also affect app mrna stability.
26297547_1	the data suggested that pdgfra was a target gene of mir-140-5p in ovarian cancer cells.
26297547_2	mir-140-5p down-regulates pdgfra expression in ovarian cancer cells posttranscriptionally

23967091_2	these results confirm that mir-140 downregulates smad3 expression by binding to smad3-3'utr in aecs.
23967091_3	these results induced by mir-140 are similar to those affected by ptx treatment, which indicates mir-140 participates in the antifibrotic process by downregulating the expression of smad3 and prevents its subsequent phosphorylation in aecs.

26399639_2	mir-132 specifically bound to the 3'utr of prkag3.

26758430_1	the results of luciferase assay indicated that mir-340 could directly target 3'-utrs of ctnnb1, rock1, and c-myc .
26758430_2	accordingly, we demonstrated that mir-340 inhibits ctnnb1, c-myc, and rock1 by direct interaction with their 3'-utrs.
26872979_1	furthermore, during chondrogenesis, dll4 expression was found to significantly decrease at both mrna and protein levels, which was negatively regulated by mir-30a through directly targeting the 3'utr of dll4.

22870299_5	the results are compatible with a down-regulation of bcl6 due to an up-regulation of the mir-205 which target this mrna.
26324892_1	these results supported the bioinformatic predictions confirming the direct targeting of mir-15b 16-2 on the ccnd2 and igf1r 3'utr.

22102413_1	we show that mir-145 directly represses sox9 expression in human cells through a unique binding site in its 3'utr not conserved in mice.
22102413_2	such mir-145 overexpression greatly decreased the levels of sox9 both at the mrna and particularly at the protein level .
22102413_3	interestingly, overexpression of mir-145 appeared to have a greater impact in hypoxic conditions and largely prevented the increase in sox9 expression induced by hypoxia.
22102413_4	mir-145 inhibition resulted in increased sox9 protein levels , without significant changes in sox9 mrna levels .
22102413_5	furthermore, mir-145 overexpression reduced by 2-fold the expression of a luciferase reporter containing wild type sox9 3'utr.

26041881_1	these data clearly demonstrate that mir-23b regulates notch2 receptor and ets1 expressions through targeting their 3'-utrs.
23572380_1	previous studies showed that notch2 was involved in gscs proliferation, while our recent studies on notch2 as a target gene of mir-107 in glioma cells suggested that mir-107 may also modulate notch2 expression in gscs.
23572380_2	western-blotting showed that mir-107 suppressed notch2 protein expression in cd133 + u87 cells .
23572380_3	these data suggest that mir-107 can inhibit the growth of cd133 + u87 cells through down-regulation of notch2 protein, and cd133 and nestin mrna expression.

20933506_3	this result confirms that the mrna of rasa1 is directly targeted by mir-335.
20933506_4	along with the validation of rasa1 as a target of mir-335 mentioned above, these results indicate that the reduction of mir-335 at least in part causes the upregulation of rasa1 during the ratepididymal development.
26277621_1	overall, four independent assays were performed, resulting in an average 62.2% luciferase activity for mir-375 and 107.2% luciferase with mir-151a-3p, where the luciferase activity of the timm8a 3'utr vector-only samples were set at 100%.
26277621_2	with this in mind, a luciferase assay was carried out to confirm if mir-151a-5p is able to bind directly to the 3'utr of sox17 mrna.
26277621_3	we co-transfected a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the sox17 3'utr into 293ft cells alongside a mir-151a-5p mimic or a mir-151a-3p mimic as a negative control.
26277621_4	as an additional positive control for these assays, we also included a mir-200a mirna mimic, which has also recently been described as binding to sox17 .
26277621_5	these results imply mir-151a-5p can directly bind its predicted target gene sox17.

21768388_2	quantitative real-time pcr validated that rybb regulated 16 genes; mica regulated 9 genes; and both srnas regulated 6 genes.
21768388_3	analysis of salmonella rybb established that the highly conserved nucleotides 1-16 of rybb is usually sufficient for target repression, and that regulation critically depends on the gcc motif at the very 5' end of rybb. of the 17 candidate targets predicted to use the r16 region of rybb, 16 of 17 are significantly down-regulated by r16tom .
21768388_4	moreover, rybb-m2 is unable to down-regulate 13 of 14 targets predicted to use rybb c2for interaction , whereas 3 of 4 targets predicted not to use mutation rybb c2 maintain down-regulation.
21768388_6	mrna::gfp fusion assays validated e.coli nmpc, ompc , ompf, fiu and rlud as direct rybb targets.
21768388_10	point mutation and mrna gene reporter assays showed that ompa is subject to both parallel yet in dependent regulation by mica and rybb.
21768388_12	surprisingly, although the nucleotides involved are conserved both between e. coli and salmonella , they found that a m2' allele of e. coli tsx was regulated by neither rybb-m2 nor mica, which indicated that tsx m2'may have an altered mrna structure and that other strategies will have to be used to study dual srna control of this target in e. coli .
25419419_1	luciferase reporter assay confirmed that casp-2 was directly bound by mir-96 in rgc-5 cells, and sirna-regulated silencing of casp2 gene rescued the apoptosis in rgc-5 induced by over-expressing mir-96.

22210897_3	moreover, downregulation of mir-26a b was statistically correlated with overexpression of cdk6 and cyclin e1 in hcc tissues .
22210897_4	these data suggest that cdk6 and cyclin e1 are direct target of mir-26a b.

19342689_1	thus, these data collectively indicate that mir-346 inhibits btk expression in lps-activated ra fls.
19342689_2	we also found that in thp-1 cells transfected with mir-346 mimic, btk expression was down-regulated and that mir-346 did not repress btk expression directly, as transfection of hek293 cells with a luciferase reporter fused to btk 3'utr along with mir-346 mimic did not result in a measurable change in luciferase activity .
19342689_3	taken together, our data indicate an important role for mir-346 and btk in the regulation of il-18 release by ra fls.
22144109_1	we identify vacuole membrane protein 1 as the direct and functional downstream target of mir-210; in addition, we show that its expression is negatively correlated with the expression of mir-210 in hcc.
22144109_2	these results indicate that mir-210 can directly bind to the 3'utr of vmp1.
22144109_3	furthermore, we showed that mir-210 can suppress the messenger rna and protein levels of vmp1 in hcc cells and that there is dose-dependence between the expression of vmp1 and mir-210 .
22144109_4	taken together, these results indicate that mir-210 can down-regulate the expression of vmp1 in hcc cells by directly binding to its 3'utr, which illustrates that vmp1 may act as a downstream target of mir-210 in hcc cells.
22144109_5	these observations indicate that vmp1 is frequently down-regulated in hcc samples, and the reduction may be caused by the overexpression of mir-210.
22144109_6	together, the effect of overexpression of vmp1 on hcc cells was the opposite of that of mir-210, and reduction of vmp1 phenocopied the effect of mir-210 on hcc cells, suggesting that vmp1 may be a functional target of mir-210 in hcc.
22144109_7	these results indicated that vmp1 is a bona fide functional target of mir-210 in hcc cells.
22730517_1	using bioinformatic tools , we identified the smad3 gene as a candidate target of mir-23b and mir-29b.
22730517_2	the same reporter construct of the previous experiments, but carrying the insert in antisense orientation, was insensitive to the effects of mir-23b and mir-29b , proving that the modifications of the target sites of smad3 3'utr are able to block the function of these mirna.
22730517_4	6. smad3 mrna expression is inversely correlated with mir-23b and mir-29b expression in experimental and human goiters.
26206559_1	taken togeter, these data strongly point to the regulation of arg1, cxcl12 and il16 both mrna and protein levels by mir-210 in splenic mdscs.

26151913_2	pax7 overexpression abolished the differentiation induced by mir-431, as indicated by the reactivity and expression of mhc.
26151913_3	together, the unique expression pattern of mir-431 and its binding sites at the 3'utr of pax7 mrna suggests that mir-431 regulates myogenesis by targeting pax7.

23157748_1	up-regulation of mir-383 knockdowns the expression of prdx3, inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis of daoy cells, leading to increased intracellular ros and decreased levels of mitochondrial membrane potential.
26179126_1	insr gene is a direct target of mir-15b.
26179126_2	overall, this indicates that mir-15b targets insr 3'utr directly through its binding site and subsequently represses insr expression at the posttranscriptional level.
26179126_3	because insr was found to be an authentic target of mir-15b, the upregulation of mir-15b should repress insr expression, leading to impaired insulin signaling in hepatocytes.

26247736_2	overexpression of mir-26a inhibited the luciferase activity of reporters of smad1 and gsk3-beta, whereas knockdown of mir-26a increased the luciferase activity of both reporters.
26247736_3	real-time reverse transcription-pcr showed that the mrna levels of smad1 and gsk3-beta were not significantly changed after overexpression or knockdown of mir-26a , indicating that mir-26a functions through post-transcriptional regulation.

20075075_2	real time quantitative pcr of klf4 mrna showed that mir-10b overexpression or inhibition had no effect on klf4 mrna level , which indicated the post-transcriptional regulation of mir-10b on klf4 mrna.
20075075_3	the decreased klf4 expression in mir-10b overexpressing cells was due to the post-transcriptional regulation of mir-10b.

20407606_2	this mir-145-mediated suppression of cell invasion is in part due to the silencing of the metastasis gene mucin 1 .
20407606_4	we also confirmed by ectopic expression and sirna knockdown, the ability of muc1 to promote cell invasion which can be reversed by mir-145. of interest, suppression of muc1 by mir-145 causes a reduction of -beta-catenin as well as the oncogenic cadherin-11.
26199425_1	these results indicated that mir-570 and mir-378 regulate cyp2e1 expression in haplotype-dependent and haplotype-independent manners, respectively.

26754670_1	forced expression of mir-208a promoted cell proliferation and induced radioresistance via targeting p21 with a corresponding activation of the akt mtor pathway in lung cancer cells, whereas down-regulation of mir-208a resulted in the opposite effects.
26754670_2	the present study provides evidence that mir-208a can affect the proliferation and radiosensitivity of human lung cancer cells by targeting p21 and can be transported by exosomes.
26754670_3	these results indicated p21 as a target of mir-208a for its regulatory function in lung cancer.
26754670_4	among the differentially expressed mirnas, mir-208a promoted lung cancer cell proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis by targeting p21 and akt mtor pathway.

26887050_5	luciferase reporter assays assessing mir-138 binding to the bim-3'utr region confirmed bim as a direct target of mir-138.
26887050_6	figure 4: bim downregulation via mir-138 confers tmz resistance to glioma cells.
19549910_1	two mirnas, mir-15a and mir-16, which are located at chromosome 13q14, have been implicated in cell cycle control and apoptosis, but little information is available about their role in solid tumors.
19549910_3	here, we show that mir-15a mir-16 are frequently deleted or down-regulated in squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung. in these tumors, expression of mir-15a mir-16 inversely correlates with the expression of cyclin d1.
19360360_3	subsequently, rtkn is identified as a potential mir-145 target by bioinformatics.
19360360_4	using reporter constructs, we show that the rtkn 3' untranslated region carries the directly binding site of mir-145.
19360360_5	additionally, overexpression of mir-145 in mcf-7 reduces rtkn protein expression as well as mrna level.
19360360_7	taken together, we propose that loss of mir-145 may provide a selective growth advantage for mcf-7 by targeting rtkn.
18945769_1	thus, the reporter assays demonstrated that targets such as pu.1, cebpe, hivep2, bcl2l13, and pdcd6 can be negatively regulated by both gga-mir-155 and mdv-1-mir-m4.
26351562_2	ovexpression of mir- 125b also inhibited pth1r downstream targets such as rankl and il- 8 expression, whereas knockdown of this mirna increased rankl and il- 8 expression , further indicating that pth1r is a target of mir- 125b in gct cells.
26351562_3	here, pth1r as a direct target of mir- 125b was further confirmed in luciferase activity assays and mir- 125b-mediated pthr1 expression analysis.
25174704_1	mir-195 overexpression resulted in a reduction in cell proliferation. in addition, the overexpression of mir-195 in hcc cells induced g1 phase cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis.
25174704_2	furthermore, wnt3a was demonstrated to be directly targeted by mir-195.
25174704_3	these findings suggest that mir-195 is key in regulating cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis through targeting wnt3a. in addition, overexpression of mir-195 may be a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of hcc.
26097868_1	to further confirm nrp1 as a mir-148a target, mir-148a binding site in the nrp1 3'utr region was mutated by site directed mutagenesis as shown in figure 5b. the cells expressing nrp1 3'utr mutant construct failed to show reduction in the luciferase activity in the presence of mir-148a.
26097868_3	therefore, mir-148a appears to target only the full length nrp1 isoform and not the 80 kda isoform as it lacks the 3'utr.
18505919_1	the mir-34a and mir-34c mimics showed dramatic growth inhibition in cell lines with 1p36 hemizygous deletion.
18505919_4	expression of mir-34a was also decreased in primary tumors with 1p36 deletion , but no mutations were discovered in resequencing of the mir-34a locus in 30 neuroblastoma cell lines.
18505919_5	bcl2 and mycn were identified as mir-34a targets and likely mediators of the tumor suppressor phenotypic effect.
16166379_1	when sgrs rna was induced, it resulted in the destabilization of ptsg mrna.the
16166379_2	degradation of ptsg mrna mediated by sgrs no longer occurred in a newly constructed strain totally lacking the hfq gene.
16166379_3	the sgrs level in the hfq strain was significantly decreased as presumed because of its reduced stability in the absence of hfq as observed in other hfq-binding small rnas.the
16166379_4	finding that hfq is tightly associated with rnase e strongly suggest that sgrs associates with rnase e through hfq.
23831330_1	it was further demonstrated in vitro that mir-30a was able to bind the 3- untranslated region of snai1 and overexpression of mir-30a blocked tgf--beta1-搃nduced up-regulation of snai1 and, therefore, inhibited emt and collagen expression.
23831330_2	as shown in figure 5b, overexpression of mir-30a in hmrsv5 cells attenuated the activity of wild-type snai1 3'utr reporter to 35%, which was not found in the mutant snai1 3'utr reporter.
23831330_3	interestingly, western blot analysis and real-time pcr showed that mir-30a overexpression dramatically down-regulated the protein level of snai1 , but did not alter its mrna level , demonstrating that mir-30a repressed the translation of snai1, but did not induce degradation of snai1 mrna.
23902770_1	because fccgammar clustering induces sflt-1 and because mir-181a was shown to negatively regulate sflt-1, we asked whether mir-181a was basally expressed in monocytes but down-regulated upon fcgammar activation.
23902770_2	figure 6. fcgammar clustering down-regulates mir181a while up-regulating sflt-1 transcription and protein synthesis.
18710938_1	these data are consistent with cyclin d1 protein and mrna expression patterns in differentiating mescs and with cyclin d1 being a target of mir-302 translational repression.//cyclin
18710938_2	d1 protein was significantly diminished in cells transfected with pre-mir-302a compared to its level in cells transfected with the negative control pre-mir, while cyclin d1 mrna was expressed at the same level in cells transfected with pre-mir-302a and negative control pre-mir.//the
18710938_3	cdk4 protein levels were increased in response to the inhibition of mir-302 in hescs , suggesting that cdk4 is also a target of mir-302.
18710938_4	additionally, the transfection of pre-mir-302a into hela cells caused the cdk4 protein levels to decrease , demonstrating that cdk4 is a target of mir-302 even in a heterologous system.these
18710938_5	data strongly suggest that mir-302a, -b, -c, and -d translationally repress cyclin d1 in hescs.
25337211_2	meanwhile mir-29b could induce apoptosis of mg63.
25337211_3	besides, mir-29b directly targets vegf and over-expression of mir-29b led to down-regulation of vegf protein level.
22210864_2	therefore, we performed 3'utr reporter assays for mir-1 interference with translation using reporter constructs containing wild-type and mutant 3'-utrs of fn1, lasp1 and ptma.
22210864_3	xpo6 and notch3 have previously been shown to be a direct targetby mir-1 or mir-206.
22210864_4	the findings indicate that some of the mir-1 phenotypes in prostate cancer cells could be mediated by mir-1-induced disturbances of the actin filament network by directly targeting expression of fn1, lasp1 and xpo6, among other candidate transcripts that encode actin binding partners.
22210864_5	we found that mir-1 induces re-localization of lasp1 from the nucleus into the cytoplasm , which could be a compensatory process following lasp-1 down-regulation by mir-1.
23876508_1	mir-320a negatively regulates the expression of smar1 by directly binding to its 3'utr. in response to mild dna damage, mir-320a expression is decreased resulting in enhanced expression of smar1 protein, which in turn, reduces its targets, bax and puma inhibiting apoptosis.
21273305_1	we found that mir-539 and mir-381 are down-regulated by kit signaling and they repressed mitf expression through conserved mirna binding sites in the mitf 3'-untranslated region.
21273305_2	taken together, these results are consistent with the conclusion that the 3'utr of mitf is specifically regulated by mir-539 and mir-381.
21273305_3	figure 7 mir-381 and mir-539 targetthe 3'utr of mitf.
26548724_1	bioinformatics analysis revealed that mir-326 had a putative binding site within the 3'-untranslated region of nsbp1.
26548724_3	these results indicated that mir-326 could target the 3'utr of nsbp1 and repress its expression in nsclc cells.
21145505_1	transfection experiments indicated that mirna-17 and mirna-20a directly repressed isl1 and tbx1.
22781587_4	this confirms that the expression of ghr is regulated by let-7b, and that the let-7b targetis located in the region of the ghr 3'utr mutation.
22431749_1	in this paper, we report that a star strand mirna, mir-30c-2 , is induced by the protein kinase rna activated-搇ike er kinase pathway of the upr and governs expression of xbp1 , a key transcription factor that augments secretory capacity and promotes cell survival in the adaptive upr.
22431749_2	therefore, mir-30c-2 is functionally competent and recognizes the predicted cognate xbp1 3'utr target site in a sequence-specific manner.
22431749_3	these data establish that mir-30c-2 has the capacity to limit induction of xbp1 mrna, xbp1 protein, and xbp1-dependent target genes.
25984739_1	moreover, our results showed that key signal molecular traf6 is a target of mir-194, overexpression of mir-194 directly decreased traf6 expression and attenuated the release of proinflammatory cytokine tnf-alpha in pa-activated monocyte thp-1.
25984739_2	we conclude that mir-194 negatively regulates the tlr4 signal pathway which is activated by pa through directly negative traf6 expression.
25984739_3	as shown in figure 2e, mir-194 downregulated traf6 protein expression, while mir-194 inhibitor upregulated traf6 .
25984739_4	all of these results indicated that mir-194 directly target traf6.
26182877_1	mir-3178 regulates angiogenesis of hcc tecs, and egr3 is the functional target of mir-3178.
26182877_2	the results indicate the silencing effect of mir-3178 on egr3 mrna.
22167321_1	we demonstrate that mir-146a, mir-99b and mir-205, induced in hcc1937 brca1-expressing cells, bindand regulate traf2 gene.
22167321_2	collectively, these luciferase and western blot results showed that mir-146a, mir-99b and mir-205 act as negative regulators of traf2 expression.
22167321_3	we have identified traf2 as a novel targetgene for mir-146, mir-99 and mir-205 and shown that these mirnas are sufficient to modulate nf-jb pathway activity in breast cancer cells.
26518362_1	interestingly, there was no significant change in luciferase activity when mutant utr was co-transfected with mir-4516, suggesting that alteration of luciferase activity was because of direct binding of mir-4516 to the predicted binding sites on the ube2n 3'utr.
26614992_1	mir-577 in hcc group had a significant negative correlation relationship with the expression of downstream target of b -catenin .
26614992_2	mir-577 may inhibit the hcc cell growth through down-regulating the expression of b -catenin.
26614992_3	therefore, the negative regulation of mir-577 on b -catenin expression, which is confirmed by the present study, may have the important clinical value to ameliorate the treatment and prognosis of sorafenib resistant patients.
26402653_1	further studies determined that p21cip1 waf1 was the direct target of mir-423-3p, and that ectopic expression of p21cip1 wf1 totally rescued the effect of mir-423-3p on crc growth.
26402653_2	these data indicated that mir-423-3p inhibited the p21cip1 waf1 3'utr by direct binding to site1.
26402653_3	these data suggested that mir-423-3p directly regulated p21cip1 waf1 expression in crc.
26402653_4	our current study showed that p21cip1 waf1 was the direct target of mir-423-3p in inhibition of crc occurrence.
18684319_1	utilizing human cell lines, we demonstrate that mirnas hsa-mir-106a and hsa-mir-520c bindto their predicted targetsequences in the app 3'utr and negatively regulate reporter gene expression.
18684319_2	over-expression of these mirnas, but not control mirnas,result utilizing human cell lines, we demonstrate that mirnas hsa-mir-106a and hsa-mir-520c bind to their predicted targetsequences in the app 3'utr and negatively regulate reporter gene expression.
18684319_3	over-expression of these mirnas, but not control mirnas,results in translational repression of app mrna and significantly reduces app protein levels.
18684319_4	we observed that mir-520c over-expression significantly decreased luciferase activity when the putative mir-106a targetsite was included in the reporter compared to either a reporter lacking the putative targetsite or a reporter carrying a seed-region mutant of the putative mir-106a targetsite .
19308264_1	in a screening of mb cell lines, the mirna mir-199b-5p was seen to be a regulator of the notch pathway through its targeting of the transcription factor hes1. down-regulation of hes1 expression by mir-199b-5p negatively regulates the proliferation rate and anchorage-independent growth of mb cells.
19308264_2	mir-199b-5p over-expression blocks expression of several cancer stem-cell genes, impairs the engrafting potential of mb cells in the cerebellum of athymic nude mice, and of particular interest, decreases the mb stem-cell-like subpopulation of cells. in our analysis of 61 patients with mb, the expression of mir-199b-5p in the non-metastatic cases was significantly higher than in the metastatic cases .
19308264_4	these data showing the down-regulation of mir-199b-5p in metastatic mbs suggest a potential silencing mechanism through epigenetic or genetic alterations.
19308264_7	infection with mb cells in an induced xenograft model in the mouse cerebellum and the use of an adenovirus carrying mir-199b-5p indicate a clinical benefit through this negative influence of mir-199b-5p on tumor growth and on the subset of mb stem-cell-like cells, providing further proof of concept.
25878056_1	these explorations led to the identification of candidate targets of mir-199a-5p: wnt signaling, including fzd4 and wnt2 .
25878056_4	to verify that fzd4 and wnt2 are indeed repressed post transcriptionally by mir-199a-5p, we determined the effect of mir-199a-5p on protein expression.
25878056_5	the results of western blot analysis indicated that mir-199a-5p markedly lowered the levels of fzd4 and wnt2 proteins in mc3t3-e1.
25878056_6	the results indicated that mir-199a-5p significantly decreased fzd4 and wnt2 protein expression,and amo-199a-5p increased it.
26102062_1	collectively, our results suggested that prlr is a direct target gene of mir-135a, mir-135a is a novel regulator of prlr, and it might play an essential role in the regulation of animal mammary gland development and lactation.
26102062_2	these results indicated that mir-135a could directly target the 3'utr sequences of prlr; prlr is a direct target gene of mir-135a.
26102062_3	these results suggested that prlr expression is directly targeted and regulated by mir-135a, mir-135a is a negatively regulator of prlr.
26102062_4	this is the first study to show that prlr is negatively regulated by mir-135a at the post-transcriptional level through its target site within the 3'utr .
23579070_1	these suggest that mir-135a targets irs2 levels by binding to its 3'utr and this interaction regulates skeletal muscle insulin signaling.
23579070_2	these results imply towards a specific interaction between mir-135a and irs2 to regulate endogenous irs2 levels.
23579070_3	all these suggest that mir-135a decreases irs2 levels by binding to its 3'utr.
20844033_1	we further analyzed changes in mir-126, an ec-specific mirna that regulates vascular integrity by suppressing spred1 and pik3r2 mrnas.the
21982769_1	mir-146a decreased the sensitivity to ifn-alpha through the suppression of apoptosis.
21982769_2	further experiments showed that mir-146a-related resistance to ifn-alpha was mediated through smad4.
22040413_1	then western blotting analysis and luciferase reporter assay were measured to determine whether fak was indeed regulated by mir-7.
22040413_2	these indicate that mir-7 modulates fak expression via its 3'utr.
22040413_3	meanwhile, pearson's correlation analysis showed that mir-7 expression was negatively correlated with fak expression .
22040413_4	figure 2. mir-7 directly target the 3'utr of fak mrna in glioma cell line.
21526342_1	taken together, these data imply that mir-126-3p may attenuate the expression of pgr by directly targeting the 3'utr of pgr.
21526342_2	fig. 1 mir-126-3p target 3'utr of pgr mrna. in conclusion, pgr gene confirmed mir-126-3p targetgenes through luciferase activity and western blotting.
21526342_3	and mir-126-3p could also inhibit proliferation of mousemammary epithelial cells and expression of -beta-casein , and down-regulate pgr protein .
26165303_1	luciferase reporter was employed to confirm the binding sites in 3'utr region of celf2 for mir-95-3p.
26165303_2	the correlation between expression of celf2 and mir-95-3p was determined by western blotting and qrt-pcr both in cell lines and human samples.
26165303_3	results showed celf2 was a direct target of mir-95-3p and expression levels of celf2 and mir-95-3p were negatively correlated.
26165303_4	finally, celf2 largely abrogated the effects of mir-95-3p on proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of glioma cells in rescue experiments, which verified the role of celf2 in mir-95-3p regulating glioma biological behavior.
26165303_5	in conclusion, our data suggest the expression level of mir-95-3p is positively related to glioma grade and downregulation of mir-95-3p affects proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of glioma cells by targeting celf2.
26165303_6	we identified mir-95-3p as a putative therapeutic target and celf2 as a potential tumor suppressor.
26165303_7	based on the above, we proved that mir-95-3p suppresses celf2 gene expression by regulating 3'utr at the post-transcription level.
26314959_1	notably, we identified that overexpression of mir-625-3p inhibited the expression of scai, while depletion of mir-625-3p increased scai level, suggesting that scai could be a target of mir-625-3p.
26314959_2	our findings demonstrated that mir-625-3p could promote cell migration and invasion through inhibition of scai and its target e-cadherin.
26314959_3	here, our data suggest that mir-625-3p inhibited scai and led to increased migration and invasion in crc cells.
26648817_1	mir-15b and mir-219-5p was predicted to induce hematopoietic differentiation due to targeting sall4 in different levels.
26648817_2	we hypothesized hsa-mir-15b and hsa-mir-219-5p have potential for targeting sall4.
26648817_3	as predicted by mirbase, 3'utr of sall4 had complementary sequence for has-mir-15b and has-mir-219-5p seed sequence.
26648817_4	these results indicate that down-regulation of hsa-mir-15b and consequently up regulation of sall4 lead to in the expansion of primary hscs.
26648817_5	based on our analyses, mir-15b targets sall4 mrna and reduced its expression in hscs.
22020437_1	escs over-expressing mir-34a, mir-34b, or mir-34c for 48 hours had decreased nanog, sox2 and n-myc protein levels , but unaltered mrna abundance .
24824743_1	taken together, these results suggest that mir-218 regulates mitf expression by directly binding its gene at 3'utr. in our study, a novel function and mechanism of mir-218 was found in its targeting of mitf 3'utr and suppression of melanogenesis in a normal melanocyte model of murine melan-a cells.
24824743_2	a luciferase activity assay demonstrated the direct binding of mir-218 to the 3'utr of the mitf gene .
26394192_1	mir-340 directly targets the 3'utr of hmgn5.
26394192_2	these results indicate that mir-340 directly targeted the 3'utr of hmgn5.
26394192_3	the data further confirmed that mir-340 targeted and regulated hmgn5.
26143374_2	eif4e expression was dramatically reduced after transfection with mir-206 .
26258411_1	altogether, these data reveal that mir-373 directly suppresses the translation of itga2 by binding to the itga2-3'utr.
24039891_1	to further evaluate the putative differential targeting of the mir-375 5- -isomirs, we selected the following three genes: mtpn, which regulates insulin secretion, is a known target of the 5- -reference mir-375 , but is not predicted to be targeted by the 5- -shifted isoforms; atp6v0c, which mediates glucose-sensitive intracellular vesicular transport and is predicted to be preferentially targeted by the 5- -shifted isoform mir-375+1; and cdc42, which is essential for the second phase of insulin secretion and is predicted to be preferentially targeted by the 5- -shifted isoform mir-375-1.
26117405_1	using microarray and bioinformatics analyses, pgc-1alpha was identified as a common target gene of mir-19b-3p, mir-221-3p and mir-222-3p, which are mainly located in the intima of atherosclerotic vessels. in vitro induction of mir-19b-3p, mir-221-3p and mir-222-3p by the inflammatory cytokines tnfalpha and ifngamma may affect pgc-1alpha protein production and consequently result in mitochondrial dysfunction in human aortic endothelial cells .
26117405_2	taken together, these results suggest that the drastic increase in the expression levels of micrornas mir-19b-3p, mir-221-3p and mir-222-3p in atherosclerotic vessels modulates pgc-1alpha protein production via targeting the 3'utr of pgc-1alpha.
22438559_1	fig 3 the 8-hpi network shows a number of deregulated mirnas and their predicted targets, including mir-766, that is consistently upregulated throughout infection with h1n1.
20819078_1	furthermore, as shown by quantitative real-time rt-pcr and western blotting , ectopic transfection of mir-7 reduced the level of igf1r at both the mrna and protein levels.
20819078_2	knockdown of mir-7 led to increases in both igf1r mrna and protein.
20819078_3	thus these results demonstrated that mir-7 regulates igf1r expression by directly targeting the 3'utr of the igf1r mrna.
20819078_4	together with the observed mir-7 effects on igf1-induced akt activation, these results suggest that mir-7 regulates tscc cell growth, at least in part, by targeting igf1r.
26354435_1	down-regulation of mir-125b, which targets gab2, mediates par 2 -induced cancer cell migration.
26354435_2	moreover, grb associated-binding protein 2 was identified as a novel target gene of mir-125b and it mediated par 2 -induced cell migration.
26354435_3	all these results suggest that mir125b partially regulates gab2 expression through the binding site within 3'utr of gab2 mrna.
26354435_4	gab2 was identified as a novel target of mir-125b in the current study.
17761882_1	mir-133b regulates the maturation and function of midbrain dns within a negative feedback circuit that includes the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor pitx3
20736237_2	we tested whether mir-27b is able to regulate mef2c by generating luciferase reporter constructs with wild-type and mir-27 "seed" sequence-mutated mef2c 3'-utrs. in addition, we tested whether other micrornas, which have no predicted target site on the mef2c 3'utr, might affect mef2c.
20736237_3	overexpression of mir-125a or mir-219 does not modify mef2c transcript levels .
20736237_4	thus, our data demonstrate a role for mir-27b regulating mef2c expression levels in myogenic cells.
23086751_1	restoration of mir-30b or mir-30c expression during kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus infection attenuated viral induction of dll4.
23086751_2	together these results demonstrate that the highly conserved molecular targeting of dll4 by the mir-30 family regulates angiogenesis.
23086751_3	figure 2 mir-30b and mir-30c regulate dll4.
23086751_4	taken together, these data indicate that the mir-30 family regulates endogenous dll4.
23086751_5	these data indicate that mir-30 influences the expression of dll4 in endothelial cells by targeting a predicted site within its 3'utr.
23316333_1	tsp-1 is the main target of mir-467 and the main mediator in regulation of angiogenesis.
23316333_2	the experiments with the constructs, in which the binding site for mir-467 was mutated, demonstrated that the direct binding of mir-467 to the 3'utr of tsp-1 is required for the translational silencing of tsp-1 mrna in response to high glucose.
23316333_3	mutation of the mir-467 binding site in tsp-1 3'utr or mir-467 inhibitor relieved the translational silencing and restored tsp-1 production.
26604785_1	mir-328 and ptprj mrna expression levels were markedly upregulated and downregulated in hcc tissues.
26604785_2	the upregulation of mir-328 in hcc tissues was significantly correlated with the downregulation of ptprj mrna in hcc tissues
26092503_2	the time courses of expressions of mir-320 and phospho-hsp20 in the spinal cord, after the transient ischemia, indicated that expression of phospho-hsp20 was negatively correlated with expression of mir-320.
26092503_3	transfection of antagomir-320 significantly reduced expression of mir-320 in the spinal cord and dramatically up-regulated expression of phospho-hsp20.
20549700_1	to unravel the mechanism by which mir-125b restrains g1 s transition, we examined possible cell cycle-related target of e2f3, cyclin a2, cyclin e1, cyclin d1, cdc6 and cdk6.
20549700_2	we found that induction of mir-125b inhibited cyclin a2 at the mrna level in both t24 and 5637 cell lines, whereas cyclin e1, cyclin d1, cdc6 and cdk6 were almost unchanged compared with nc-transfectants .
24980823_1	mir-143 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting n-ras and enhances temozolomide-induced apoptosis in glioma.
25569036_1	expression of mir-708 results in decreased ovarian cancer cell migration invasion and metastasis mainly through targeting rap1b.
25569036_2	although our data only reflected mrna levels, and some genes might be affected translationally, we decided to focus on rap1b as the major target of mir-708 in ovarian cancer.
25569036_3	co-expression of anti-mir-708 fully reversed mir-708-mediated inhibition, indicating that rap1b is a direct downstream target of mir-708.
21642433_3	we found that mir-10b reduced the activity of a luciferase reporter gene fused to the wild-type 3'utr of hoxd10 , but had no effect on the 3'utr of nrp2 or nr4a3 .
21642433_4	to test the binding specificity of mir-10b, specific base pair mutations on the 3'utr of hoxd10 mrna was performed using the site-directed mutagenesis method followed by co-transfection with mir-10b.
21642433_5	this suggested that mir-10b specifically targeted the 3'utr of hoxd10 mrna . in addition, we observed significant expression of the luciferase reporter gene fused to the 3'utr of hoxd10 after anti-mir-10b treatment .
21642433_6	to determine whether mir-10b could disrupt endogenous hoxd10 expression in endothelial cells, cell lysates from mir-10b-transfected or vector control hmec-1 cells were analyzed.
21642433_7	although mir-10b slightly inhibited mrna expression of hoxd10 in hmec-1 cells, it might impair hoxd10 expression through translational inhibition.
21642433_8	indeed, expression of the hoxd10 protein was significantly reduced in cells that overexpressed mir-10b .
21642433_9	these results suggest that hoxd10 is indeed an important functional target of mir-10b in hmec-1.
21642433_10	our results showed that inhibition of mir-10b expression and up-regulation of hoxd10 expression were implicated in this process.
26886754_1	in this study, we first investigated the effects of atorvastatin on mir-126 and its target gene, i.e., vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in apolipoprotein e-knockout mice with carotid atherosclerotic plaque in vivo.
26886754_2	these data indicated that the down-regulated expression of mir-126 and the up-regulated expression of vcam-1 were involved in atherosclerotic formation and that treatment with atorvastatin regulated the level of mir-126 mrna expression .
22728051_1	loss of mir-21 also increased cleavage of caspase-3 and increased phosphorylation of elongation factor-2 in both cell lines.
22728051_2	our studies indicate regulation of pdcd-4 expression is not a primary mir-21 function in leiomyomas, but instead mir-21 is able to impact cellular apoptosis and translation, through unknown targets, in a manner consistent with its involvement in the pathophysiology of uterine fibroids.
22580051_1	therefore, we concluded that the inserted fragment of igf-ir was the target of mir-139.
23132946_1	furthermore, our studies demonstrate that pbx3 and meis1 are two direct targetgenes of mir-495, and forced expression of either of them can reverse the effects of mir-495 overexpression on inhibiting cell viability and promoting apoptosis of human mll-rearranged leukemic cells.
23132946_2	finally, our luciferase reporter and mutagenesis assays showed that mir-495 targeted the 3'utr of both pbx3 and meis1 directly .
23132946_3	thus, several lines of evidence indicate that both pbx3 and meis1 are direct targetgenes of mir-495.
23132946_4	therefore, our data suggest that both pbx3 and meis1 are functionally important targetgenes of mir-495 in mll-rearranged leukemic cells.
25424744_1	to validate the interactions between mir-125b and hottip, luciferase reporter assay was performed with wild-type and seed-sequence mutated mir-125b target sequences of hottip.
25424744_2	when mir-125b precursor was cotransfected with the putative mir-125b target sequence of hottip in bel7402 cells, the luciferase signal was significantly suppressed as compared to the empty vector control, while the suppressive effect was significantly attenuated when the putative binding site was mutated.
26850595_1	abcb1 was a direct downstream target of mir-873 and downregulated by binding of mir-873 to its 3'utr.
26850595_2	the predicted seed region in the 3'utr of abcb1 showed that abcb1 was a direct target of mir-873.
19131573_1	mutations in the predicted mir-124a seed region abolished this repression, thus strongly indicating that mir124 binds the predicted targetsite in the ratgr mrna.
19131573_2	interestingly, mir-124a up-regulation is associated with a 70% reduction of gr protein , suggesting an interaction between endogenous mir-124a and gr mrna.
26679605_1	furthermore, mir-186 induced downregulation of jagged1 protein expression by directly targeting its 3 ' -untranslated region .
26679605_3	based on the collective results, we propose that mir-186 regulates protein expression of jagged1 by directly targeting its 3'utr region.
26324325_1	using bioinformatic analyses, we found that mucin 1 was a potential target for mir-1291.
26324325_2	luciferase assays were performed to reveal that mir-1291 inhibited muc1 expression by targeting the seed region of muc1 3'-untranslated region .
26324325_3	we also found that the expression of muc1 lacking in 3'utr abrogated the anti-invasion and pro-apoptosis function of mir-1291.
26324325_4	our results demonstrated the importance of mir-1291 in targeting muc1 for the regulation of esophagus cancer growth, invasion and apoptosis, and may be helpful for developing new targets for early diagnosis or new therapeutic targets for escc.
26324325_5	these results indicated that mir-1291 negatively regulated muc1 expression by directly binding to the 3'utr seed region in escc.
15210934_1	as in e. coli, induction of the prrf srnas leads to the rapid loss of mrnas for sodb , sdh , and a gene encoding a bacterioferritin.
15210934_2	thus, the prrf srnas are the functional homologs of ryhb srna.
21857646_1	we identify camta1 as an mir-9 9 and mir-17 target indeed, mir-9 inhibition effects on colony formation were rescued by camta1 depletion.
21857646_2	increased firefly activity was not observed, when reporters with mutated mir-9 or mir-9 bindsg sites were transfected.
21857646_3	furthermore, endogenous camta1 mrna as well as protein levels were elevated, when mir-9 or mir-9 was inhibited . of note, protein levels were much stronger increased than mrna levels, suggesting that mir-9 9 may preferentially inhibit camta1 translation.
21857646_4	we also observed a significant rescue of mir-9 inhibition, although not as strong as observed for mir-9.
21857646_5	indeed, overexpression of camta1 reduced the number of cd133+ cells, suggesting that the mir-9 9 effect is at least in part due to camta1 inhibition .
21857646_6	strikingly, inhibition of mir-9 9 or mir-17 increased nppa and npr-a expression presumably by inducing camta1 expression.
21857646_7	taken together, we have found that mir-9 9 and mir-17 regulate the expression of the novel tumour suppressor camta1 in cd133+ glioblastoma cells and camta1 itself stimulates the expression of the anti-proliferative peptide nppa.
20933503_1	real-time pcr analysis revealed that upregulation of mir-218 drastically repressed the expression level of mmp-9 mrna in u87mg and snb19 glioma cells , which indicated that mir-218 mediated the downregulation of mmp-9 at the transcriptional level.
20933503_2	taken together, our results suggest that upregulation of mir-218 reduces mmp-9 expression and inactivates nf-jb signaling.
22578566_3	however, by correcting the statistical analysis excluding double positive cases in which mir-205 and lamc1 were not expressed by the same cells , we observed a significant inverse correlation between mir-205 and lamc1 expression.
22578566_4	these data further indicate that mir-205 target lamc1 also in breast cancer tissues.
22578566_5	moreover, the mutation of the mir-205 binding site in lamc1 3'utr prevented the downregulation of luciferase expression.
26898797_1	computational analysis predicted that mir-9 has two conserved binding sites in the 3'utr of elavl1.
26898797_2	to further validate that elavl1 3'utr is a direct target of mir-9, inhibition of mir-9 signi铿乧antly increased luciferase activity when compared to human cardiomyocytes transfected with mirna inhibitor negative control transfected cells.
26898797_3	these data evidently supports that mir-9 directly regulates elavl1.
26617805_1	the results showed that socs1 was a directly target gene of mir-19a.
26617805_2	we next investigated whether mir-19a could directly down-regulate socs1 expression in neuropathic pain models by western blotting analysis.
26617805_3	all these results implied that mir-19a might suppress socs1 in neuropathic pain models.
23764849_2	theseresults demonstrated the specific inhibition of akt3 expression by mir-29.
23764849_3	collectively, mir-29 inhibits myoblast proliferation by targeting the proliferation-associated genes akt3 and p85a.
26822763_3	these results indicate that mir-107 directly modulate cdk6 expression by binding mir-107 seed complementary site located in 3'utr of cdk6.
26822763_4	furthermore, rt-pcr and western blot analysis showed that knockdown of neat1 in lscc cells led to increased level of mir-107 and decreased level of cdk6 protein .
24396870_1	hsa-mir-125b suppresses bladder cancer development by down-regulating oncogene sirt7 and oncogenic long non-coding rna malat1.
23322776_1	luciferase activity was reduced ~40% by mir-27a expression, but not by mir-24 expression , confirming that mir-27a indeed target the 3'utr of gata-2 mrna in this cell type.
23322776_2	taken together, these results demonstrate that son knockdown up-regulates mir-27a, which, in turn, target the 3'utr of gata-2 and down-regulates gata-2 expression.
23322776_3	our data revealed that reduction of the son level leads to depletion of the protein level of hematopoietic transcription factor gata-2 and this is mediated by mir-27a targeting gata-2 3'utr.
23322776_4	we also observed that the 3'utr of gata-2 with mir-27a binding site mutated was still affected, albeit less, by son sirna , which suggests other mirnas, in addition to mir-27a, regulated by the son level also targetthis 3'utr to contribute to fine-tuning of the gata-2 protein level.
22362728_1	the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay results showed that ccnd3 was a direct target of mir-138.
22362728_2	these results indicated that mir-138 may be associated with ccnd3 and both of them may be involved in hcc tumorigenesis.
22362728_3	furthermore, transfection of mir-138 mimic decreased ccnd3 expression and transfection of mir-138 inhibitor increased ccnd3 expression in hepg2 cells at protein but not mrna level , suggesting that ccnd3 expression could be inhibited by mir-138 at post-transcriptional level.
22362728_4	together, the results show that mir-138 could regulate the expression of endogenous human ccnd3 by directly targeting the 3'utr of ccnd3 mrna and human ccnd3 is a new target of mir-138.
22362728_5	these results indicate that ccnd3 is most likely involved in the induction of cell cycle arrest by mir-138.
22362728_6	our data suggest the frequently downregulated mir-138 can regulate ccnd3 and function as a tumor suppressor in hcc.
21448283_1	since mir-34a is a direct target of p53 in many pathways 11, we next used p53 sufficient and deficient cell line hct116 p53+/+ cells and hct116 p53-/- cells to study the possible relationship of mir-34a and p53 in radio-sensitivity.
21448283_3	these data indicate that mir-34a is positively correlated to cellular radio-sensitivity and the induction of mir-34a was in a p53 dependent manner.
26820394_1	these results confirmed that mir-1 and mir-214 mimic transfection downregulated pim1 expression in mesothelioma cells.
26820394_2	here we add mir-1, mir-214 and its prediction target pim1 gene as possible target of therapeutic potential in mesothelioma.
26820394_3	in addition, by transfecting mir-1 and mir-214 mimic to two cell lines, acc-meso-1, and crl-5915, we also found the downregulation of pim1 protein expression suggesting the role of mir-1, and mir-214 in inhibition of pim1 expression.
21584493_2	the results indicated that rasa1 and rac1, related to cardiac hypertrophy, or tgfb3 and col1a1, related to myocardial fibrosis, were significantly increased in the heart tissue of diabetic mice .
22681957_1	over-expression of mir-221 222 increased cell invasion, whereas knockdown of mir-221 222 decreased cell invasion via modulating the levels of the target, timp3.
22681957_2	the present data indicate that mir-221 and mir-222 directly regulate cell invasion by targeting timp3 and act as prognostic factors for glioma patients.
22681957_3	furthermore, knockdown of mir-221 222 decreased invasion capability, reduced tumor growth and up-regulated the expression of the target, timp3, whereas ectopic expression of mir-221 222 exhibited the opposite effects.
22681957_4	these data indicate that mir-221 222 can directly modulate timp3 expression by binding to the 3'utr of timp3 in gliomas.
26844630_1	in silico analysis predicted two putative mir-932 target sites locate in the cds region of dnlg2 instead of regular 3'utr mirna binding sites.
26844630_2	employing luciferase reporter assay, we further proved that the mir-932 regulates expression of its host gene dnlg2 via the binding cds region of dnlg2.
26844630_3	consistently, we observed mir-932 downregulated expression of dnlg2 in s2 cell, and the repression of dnlg2 by mir-932 at both protein and rna level.
26844630_4	furthermore, we found cds-located site1 is dominant for regulating expression of host dnlg2 by mir-932.
26844630_5	these results support the idea that dnlg2 may be a bona fide target of its intronic mir-932.
26844630_6	our results showed that cds region of host dnlg2 could be directly targeted by mir-932 and the level of dnlg2 as well as its mrna were decreased by mir-932.
20110463_2	taken together, the above data suggest that mir-221 target icam-1 3'utr, resulting in posttranscriptional suppression in cholangiocytes.
20110463_3	moreover, no significant change in icam-1 mrna levels was found between the control cells and cells treated with anti-mir-221 , suggesting that mir-221 does not induce icam-1 mrna degradation.
25234165_1	luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that mir-29b targeted psme4 that encodes the proteasome activator pa200.
25234165_2	taken together, our study identifies mir-29b replacements as the first-in-class mir-based pis that also disrupt the autophagy pathway and highlight their potential to synergistically enhance the antimyeloma effect of bortezomib.
26879375_1	in addition, mir-640 bound to the 3'utr of hif1a mrna and then inhibited the expression of hif1a.
26879375_2	overall, these results indicated that hif1a is a target for mir-640 in huvecs and it may promote the process of angiogenesis in vitro.
21217645_1	we demonstrate herein that an microrna mir-605 is a new component in the p53 gene network, being transcriptionally activated by p53 and post-transcriptionally repressing mdm2.
21217645_2	these analyses suggest a possibility of mir-605 to regulate mdm2 expression at the post-transcriptional level on one hand and to be regulated in its own expression at the transcriptional level by p53 on the other hand.
21217645_3	figure 1 mdm2 as a target of mir-605 for post-transcriptional repression.
23098654_1	mir-24 resulted in the largest ldh release, lowest cell viability and highest apoptosis and necrosis rates in normal and ischemic myocytes.
23098654_2	additionally, the mrna and protein levels of the pro-apoptotic gene, bcl2l11, were down-regulated by mir-24 overexpression and up-regulated by mir-24 deficiency.
23098654_3	the luciferase reporter assay confirmed bcl2l11 to be a target of mir-24.
26166764_1	the txndc5 protein level decreased in rasfs after transfection with mir-573 mimic , but increased with the mir-573 inhibitor .
26166764_2	this evidence indicates that mir-573 may modulate txndc5 expression at the translational level by binding to the 3'utr of txndc5 mrna
21538319_1	we demonstrated that mir-126 directly inhibits dnmt1 translation via interaction with its 3'-untranslated region, and that overexpression of mir-126 in cd4+ t cells can significantly reduce dnmt1 protein levels.
21538319_2	taken together, these data strongly suggest that mir-126 up-regulation contributes to the reduction of dnmt1 protein levels in sle cd4+ t cells.
21538319_3	igure 2. effect of mir-126 on dnmt1 expression in cd4+ t cells, and identification of dnmt1 as an mir-126 target three days after transfection with psilencer-mir-126, mir-126 transcripts were increased by 4.68-fold, while those of the unrelated mir-142-5p gene remained unchanged.
19281778_1	indeed, cox-2 protein expression was suppressed by the overexpression of mir-101a, and the luciferase activity of reporter constructs containing the cox-2 3'utr was also suppressed by mir-101a overexpression.
19281778_2	to determine the target of mir-101a in the mammary gland, we analyzed the relationship between mir-101a and cyclooxygenase-2 .
19281778_3	cox-2 protein expression slightly decreased by dip stimulation and additionally decreased after the depletion of dip, showing an inverse relationship with the expression pattern of mir-101a.
19281778_4	we then analyzed changes in cox-2 protein expression in response to the overexpression of mir-101a and found that cox-2 was clearly suppressed by mir-101a .
19281778_5	furthermore, overexpression of mir-101a significantly reduced the luciferase activity of constructs containing the cox-2 3' -utr when compared to those containing the gapdh 3' -utr .
25027394_1	further, mir-137 was found to increase expression of e-cadherin and cytokeratin, but suppress expression of n-cadherin and vimentin.
25027394_3	these results suggest a novel mechanism that mir-137 regulates emt and inhibits cell migration via twist1 downregulation.
25027394_4	therefore, mir-137 may function as anti-migration and anti-metastasis in gist and our study provides a potential approach for developing mir-137-based therapeutic strategy for gist.
26416661_1	furthermore, mir-25 expression was negatively correlated with the protein levels of rgs3 in nsclcs tissues , indicating the possible translation inhibition of rgs3 by mir-25.
26416661_2	this result suggested that mir-25 directly targeted rgs3.
26416661_3	these results indicated that rgs3 was the functional target of mir-25 in nsclcs cells.
26416661_4	these data suggested that the upregulated mir-25 in nsclcs enhances the cell proliferation but retards cell apoptosis via rgs3.
26567220_1	further investigation revealed that igf1r, insr, ccnd2 and ccne1 were directly targeted by mir-195 and mir-497 in myoblasts.
26567220_2	this result indicates that mir-195 and mir-497 target the insr gene.
26567220_3	more importantly, the present study identified igf1r and insr as new targets of mir-195 and mir-497 in c2c12 cells.
22531314_1	mir-409-3p inhibits ht1080 cell proliferation, vascularization and metastasis by targeting angiogenin.
22531314_2	overexpression of mir-409-3p in fibrosarcoma ht1080 cells resulted in decreased steady-state level of ang transcript and ang production which were achieved through direct binding of this mirna to the ang 3'utr.
22531314_3	these data indicated that mir-409-3p downregulate ang expression through binding to its 3'utr.
25209181_1	this may be explained by the fact that mir-204-5p increases in colorectal cancer cases in order to inhibit increased activity of lc3b-ii in autophagy and bcl2 against apoptosis posttranscriptionally and to take role as tumor suppressor.
21181092_1	the signal from a luciferase reporter was significantly decreased at one mir-133a targetsite at the 3'utr of gstp1,suggesting that mir-133a directly regulates gstp1.
21181092_2	this suggests that mir-133a regulates gstp1 expression by cleavage or translational inhibition.
21181092_3	figure 5. mir-133a regulates gstp1 expression in the sas cell line at the mrna and post-transcriptional level by targeting the 3'utr of gstp1 mrna.
26460960_1	suppression of vegf-c by mir-27b, mir-101 and mir-128 was investigated by luciferase assays, western blot and elisa.
26460960_2	figure 3 mir-27b, mir-101, or mir-128 directly down-regulates vegf-c expression through posttranscriptional repression in gastric cancer cells.
26460960_3	collectively, our data suggest vegf-c is down-regulated by mir-27b, mir-101, or mir-128.
26893637_2	thus, it was concluded that ccr5 is negatively regulated by mir-107 in cervical cancer cells.
24250812_1	based on the identification of complementary binding sites in mir-223 and igf-1r mrna, it is proposed that mir-223 acts as a local regulator of igf-1r.
24250812_3	addition, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation were assayed in these two hesc populations and were compared in the presence of exogenous mir-223 and mir-223 inhibitor.
24250812_4	inhibition of mir-223 was found to maintain the undifferentiated state of hescs, while addition of mir-223 induced differentiation.
26302771_1	fxyd6 was verified to be directly interacting with mir-137, and its subsequent upregulation reversed the inhibitory effect of mir-137 upregulation in osteosarcoma.
26302771_2	therefore, the experiment of luciferase assay confirmed that fxyd6 is the downstream target of mir-137.
26302771_3	taken together, our work of dual-luciferase assay and qrt-pcr demonstrated that fxyd6 was directly linked with mir-137 in human osteosarcoma.
25228695_1	the mir-152-mediated reduction of the 14-3-3-beta expression was accompanied by an up-regulation of bax protein expression resulting in a pro-apoptotic phenotype.
26698246_1	these results confirmed that mir-155 can directly target ubqln1 3'utr and decrease it expression
19996288_2	real-time rt-pcr analysis detected a slight reduction of muc1 mrna in mir-145 cells compared with the vector control in mda-mb-231 or lm2-4142 cells, but this difference was not significant , suggesting that mir-145 silences muc1 mainly at the translational level.
19996288_3	experimental metastasis assays further supported the role of mir-145 in suppressing invasion and metastasis by targeting muc1.
19996288_4	for example, muc1 plus vector produced an average of 85 tumor nodules compared with 13 nodules from the muc1 plus mir-145 cells , similar to the invasion results.
19996288_5	these results suggest that mir-145 target muc1, which in turn causes downregulation of -beta-catenin, cyclin d1, and cadherin 11, leading to suppression of invasion and metastasis.
21770019_1	micrornas mir-16-1 and mir-15b have been reported to function as tumor suppressors and negative regulators of cell growth.
21770019_3	bcl2 and the bcl2-like anti-apoptotic proteins bcl2-associated athanogene 5 and bcl2-like 2 are targets of mir-16 and mir-15a .
20886540_1	similar to the data obtained from western blot analysis, ectopic expression of mir-125bm induced a markeddownregulation of p53, puma and bak1 .
20886540_2	taken together, these data strongly support that mir-125b down-regulates the expression of p53, puma and bak1 in cap cells.
20886540_3	taken together, these results provide experimental validation that the 3'-utrs of p53 and puma are target of mir-125b.
19133651_2	using both a luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis, we showed that microrna-101 repressed the expression of v-fos fbj murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog oncogene, a key component of the activator protein-1 transcription factor.
19133651_3	moreover, using a luciferase expression vector driven by seven copies of an ap-1 cis-element, we observed that microrna-101 expression inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate -induced ap-1 activity.
19133651_6	conclusion: microrna-101, which is aberrantly expressed in hcc, could repress the expression of the fos oncogene.
18384814_1	nfib protein usually bindhe mir-21 promoter in hl-60 cells as a negative regulator and is swept off from the mir-21 promoter during pma-induced macrophage differentiation of hl-60.
18384814_2	the translational repression of nfib mrna by mir-21 accelerates clearance of nfib in parallel with the simultaneous mir-21-independent transcriptional repression of nfib after pma stimulation.
18384814_3	to further validate whether nfib transcript is directly targeted by mir-21, we inserted the nfib 3'utr downstream of the luciferase gene driven by tk promoter in a reporter plasmid and transfected the resultant reporter plasmid into the pa-1 cell line, which expresses only marginal endogenous mir-21 .
18384814_5	such mir-21-dependent reduction was never observed when a reporter plasmid that has mutation in the mirna recognition element for mir-21 was used instead .
22677435_1	the expression of ccnd1, ccnd2 and cdk6 was suppressed by mir-16 in hmscs.
22677435_2	cdk6, ccnd1, and ccnd2 were shown to be modulated by mir-16.

22771905_3	our data indicated that mir-155 could target socs1 and mitf during osteoclastogenesis, therefore, mir-155 might inhibit osteoclast differentiation by targeting socs1 and mitf, thus at least partially mediate the suppressive effect of ifn--beta on osteoclastogenesis.

22510686_1	mir-484 is able to attenuate fis1 upregulation and mitochondrial fission, by binding to the amino acid coding sequence of fis1 and inhibiting its translation.
22510686_2	in exploring the underlying mechanism of mir-484 downregulation upon apoptosis, we observe that foxo3a transactivates mir-484 expression.

26101704_2	we also generated mutated luciferase constructs , and introduced these constructs into the mir-135b binding site of lats2 3'utr.
26101704_3	we found that the binding site was responsible for the role of mir-135b in regulating lats2 expression.
26101704_4	our data indicate that mir-135b is able to target lats2 directly, and that lats2 may contribute to chemoresistance.
19903841_1	these data suggested that a clear inverse correlation existed between mir-15a and mir-16 levels and bmi-1 expression.
19903841_2	mutation of the single mir-16 site rescued the luciferase activity, thus confirming a direct interaction of mir-16 with the 3'utr of bmi-1 mrna.
19903841_3	thus, after determining that mir-15a and mir-16 target the 3'utr of bmi-1 as well as downregulate bmi-1 protein levels, we next wanted to determine the effect of these mirnas on the proliferation and clonal growth of ovarian cancer cells.

26762119_3	our results indicate that the effect of stroke serum priming on the increased proliferation rate of mscs is related to the up-regulation of mir-20a, which regulates the cell cycle inhibitor p21 cdkn1a.

26400524_2	both mir-21 and mir-183 can directly target socs6 and modulate its expression.
21145002_1	by screening gal4 enhancer traps with a uas-gfp-mcd8 reporter, we found that insertions upstream of the mir-310, -311, -312, -313 cluster exhibited activity in larval stage motor neurons.
21145002_2	these results are consistent with khc-73 being a key target of the mir-310 cluster.
21145002_3	while reducing khc-73 in motor neurons using a knockdown transgene did not significantly affect synaptic transmission, overexpression of khc-73 induced a strong increase in qc , phenocopying the effect of deleting the mir-310 cluster, thus further supporting the link between khc-73 and the mir-310 cluster.
21145002_4	our findings show that khc-73 transgene with 3'utr is much more sensitive to the endogenous levels of mir-310.
21145002_5	these results together provide strong evidence indicating that khc-73 is the relevant target of mir-310 cluster in vivo and provide some of the first evidence for in vivo relationship between mirnas and their target through seed sequences within the coding region.
21145002_6	these results together suggest that the regulation of khc-73 by mir-310 cluster in motor neurons is essential for the ability of retrograde signalling at the nmj to regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release.
26052614_1	regulation of lamc1 and mcl1 expression by mir-22 and mir-29a, respectively, was further investigated by reporter gene assays.

26052614_4	as hypothesized, higher mir-22 and mir-29a levels in the benign tissue were associated with a decreased amount of their target proteins, lamc1 and mcl-1.
26589234_1	we selected hsa-mir-193a-5p as it was shown to be down regulated in our array data and also predicted to target il-12b.

23933812_1	using the lncrna rt-pcr array carrying 83 human disease-related lncrnas, we show that mir-21 is capable of suppressing the lncrna growth arrest-specific 5 .
23933812_2	this negative correlation between mir-21 and gas5 is also seen in breast tumor specimens. of interest, gas5 can also repress mir-21 expression.
23933812_3	whereas ectopic expression of gas5 suppresses, gas5-sirna increases mir-21 expression.
23933812_4	importantly, there is a putative mir-21-binding site in exon 4 of gas5; deletion of the mir-21-binding site abolishes this activity.
23933812_6	we further show that the biotin-labeled gas5-rna probe is able to pull down the key component of the rna-induced silencing complex and we subsequently identify mir-21 in this gas5-risc complex, implying that mir-21 and gas5 may regulate each other in a way similar to the microrna-mediated silencing of target mrnas.
21993663_1	we demonstrated that mir-200bc 429 cluster might play an important role in the development of mdr in human gastric and lung cancer cell lines by targeting the anti-apoptotic genes bcl2 and xiap. in both sgc7901 vcr and a549 cddp cells, a significant decrease in relative luciferase activity was noted when pgl3-bcl2-3'utr or pgl3-xiap-3'utr was co-transfected with the mir-200bc 429 cluster mimics, but not with the mirna mimic control, respectively , suggesting that bcl2 and xiap were the common targetgenes of the mir-200bc  429 cluster.
21993663_2	since bcl2 and xiap were both anti-apoptotic protein and the target of the mir-200bc 429 cluster, we hypothesized that the mir-200bc 429 cluster might modulate multidrug resistance of cancer cells via inhibiting the bcl2 and xiap protein expression.
21993663_3	these results suggested that mir-200bc 429 might modulate multidrug resistance of cancer cells at least in part by inhibiting the bcl2 and xiap protein expression.
21820586_2	these findings indicate that mir-21 modulates fasl and timp3 expression by binding the 3'utr of these genes.
21820586_4	however, when we transfected with timp3 lacking 3'utr and mir-21, expression of timp3 largely overrode the mir-21 anti-apoptosis function.
21820586_5	these results indicate that timp3 is a major target of mir-21.

26101708_1	mir-30c directly targeted the ier2 3'utr.
26852921_1	interestingly, though both smad6 and smad7 are the targets of mir21, there is lack of reports that mir-21 could regulate smad6 in colon cancer cells, to the best of our knowledge.
26852921_2	to examine the smad6 expression level treated with and without inhibition of mir-21, pcr analysis were implemented.
26852921_3	as our expected, results show that the expression level of smad6 is becoming significantly higher when inhibit the level of mir-21 in colon cancer cells .

26296572_1	in silico analysis indicated that hsa-mir-23a-3p and hsa-mir-29a-3p target the coding region of cyp2c19 with hybrid stabilities of - 27.5 kcal mol and - 23.3 kcal mol, respectively.
26296572_2	rna electrophoresis mobility shift assays showed that both hsa-mir-23a-3p and hsa-mir-29a-3p mirnas were able to bind directly to their cognate targets in the cyp2c19 transcript.
26296572_3	however, our strategy did predict that hsa-mir-23a-3p and hsa-mir-29a-3p might efficiently interact with the coding region of cyp2c19.

26549849_3	ash1l is a predicted target of mir-291, which we validated using reporter assays.
26096783_1	loxl2 was a direct target gene of mir-29s, as shown by genome-wide gene expression analysis and luciferase reporter assay.
26096783_3	these data suggested that mir-29s bound directly to two specific binding sites in the 3'utr of loxl2 mrna. in this way, we identified loxl2 as a target gene of tumour-suppressive mir-29s and validated the direct binding of this mirna to the 3 0 -utr of loxl2 using luciferase reporter assays.
24505359_1	we also found that mir-545 caused cell cycle arrest at the g0 g1 phase and induced cell apoptosis in lung cancer cells by targeting cyclin d1 and cdk4 genes.
24505359_2	the effects of cyclin d1 and cdk4 down-regulated by mir-545 were similar to those caused by sirnas of cyclin d1 and cdk4, and overexpression of cyclin d1 and cdk4 could abolish the mir-545-induced inhibition of cell proliferation.
22073238_1	igf-1r was the functional targetfor mir-223 suppression of cell proliferation and its downstream pi3k akt mtor p70s6k pathway suppressed by mir-223 was by targeting igf-1r.
22073238_2	transfection with igf-1r cdna could totally overcome the suppression caused by mir-223 since the construct contained no 3'utr.
22073238_3	in the tumor tissues at xenograft nude mice, the expression of igf-1r was also suppressed in mir-223 group as compared with ev group .
22073238_4	figure 3 igf-1r was directly targeted by mir-223.
22073238_5	these results strongly indicated that mir-223 suppressed of akt mtor p70s6k pathway is by targeting igf-1r.
22073238_6	this result suggested that mir-223 targeted igf-1r not only in hela cells, but also in leukemia and hepatoma cells.

26469406_2	taken together, our data showed that mir-26a suppressed the protein levels of gsk3-beta, whereas the knockdown of mir-26a increased gsk3-beta protein expression.
26469406_3	furthermore, mir-26a repressed the translation of gsk3-beta by directly binding to position 4636- 4643 of the gsk3-beta 3'utr.
26469406_4	these findings suggested that gsk3-beta was a direct target of mir-26a.

21156648_2	together, these data indicate that the ack1 3'utr is a specific target of mir-7 and that all 3 predicted mir-7-bindsg sites in the ack1 mrna 3'utr are likely to be specific and direct target of mir-7 with a marked total effect on expression.
21156648_3	we next examined the effect of mir-7 on the endogenous mrna and protein levels of ack1.
21156648_4	elevated mir-7 levels in a mouse schwannoma cell line, nf2s-1, also produced a marked reduction in the protein levels of ack1, pak1, and egfr .
21156648_5	taken together, our data suggest that ack1 and pak1 are especially important target of mir-7 in schwannoma cell growth.
21156648_6	no significant correlation was found between mir-7 downregulation and egfr mrna upregulation , suggesting that in schwannoma samples not all mirna-mrna interactions result in degradation of mrna.
21156648_7	these results show that mir-7 is a major regulator in schwannoma growth by regulation of ack1 and pak1 expression.
26820128_1	these results suggested that pik3r3 is a target gene of mir-152 in crc.
26348153_1	mir-223-5p and -3p could negatively regulate the expression of sema3a and stat3, respectively22 ; and 3 sema3a and stat3 both contribute to inflammatory response29,30,31,32. we therefore speculated that the presence or absence of mir-223 in mscs might affect cellular levels of sema3a and stat3, which were consequently incorporated into exosomes at different concentrations.
26348153_2	put together, these results indicate that wt-exosomes could deliver mir-223 to the myocardium and consequently, inhibit the expression of sema3a and stat3, two bona fide targets of mir-223; whereas mir-223-ko exosomes could deliver sema3a and stat3 proteins to the myocardium.

21930776_3	here, we propose that the role of mir-29a b is to modulate the activity of the arp2 3 complex by targeting the regulatory subunit arpc3 , thus maintaining flexibility in neuronal net- works.
21930776_4	the aforementioned data demonstrate that arpc3 levels are directly regulated by the targeting of mir-29a or -29b to the identified 3'utr mre.
26802132_1	we identified arc as a mir-223 downstream target to mediate the function of mir-223 incardiac hypertrophy.
26802132_2	in this study, we show that heart-related circrna directly binds to mir-223 and acts as an endogenous mir-223 sponge to inhibit mir-223 activity, which results in the increase of arc expression, a target for mir-223.
26802132_3	further, we attempted to investigate whether mir-223 and arc are functionally related in hypertrophy and observed that the inhibitory effect of mir-223 knockdown on hypertrophic responses was decreased in the absence of arc , indicating that mir-223 exerts its effect through arc.

23175432_3	taken together, these results suggested that tle1 is a direct target of mir-657 in hcc cells.
23175432_4	our observations suggest that tle1 may be frequently downregulated in hcc samples and the reduction may be caused by overexpression of mir-657.
23175432_5	taken together, these results showed that mir-657 activated nf-jb, and the activation is likely mediated by tle1.

21358675_3	notably, the tumor suppressor effects of rab14 knockdown mediated by sirna were similar to those of ectopic mir-451 expression, suggesting that rab14 targeting might be a mechanism of the tumor suppressor function of mir-451 in nsclc cells.
21358675_4	taken together, our results showed that restoration of rab14 expression could partially rescue the tumor suppressor function of mir-451 in nsclc cells, which further showed that rab14 might be potentially involved in mir 451-regulated tumor suppressing function.
21358675_5	therefore, higher expression of rab14 protein was negatively associated with downregulated mir-451 in nsclc tissue samples, suggesting that rab14-mir-451 interaction might be biologically significant in human nsclc

25496461_2	these data suggest that the hypoxia-upregulated mir-98 could repress cyp19a1 expression via specific interaction with its target site in the 3'utr of the cyp19a1 mrna.
25496461_3	overexpression of pre-mir-98 led to a substantial decrease in cyp19a1 protein levels, while the anti -mir-98 treatment partially restored normal cyp19a1 protein levels .
25496461_4	overall, these results suggest that mir-98 is a hif-1-regulated mirna that downregulates cyp19a1 expression in hypoxic cells; and the reduction in cyp19a1 expression may account, in part, for the reduction in e2 production in hypoxic cells.
24486107_1	mir-1 targets pik3ca and inhibits tumorigenic properties of a549 cells.

23097559_4	these results supported the hypothesis that mir-18a executes an oncogenic effect on npc cells, at least partly, through downregulating the expression of dicer1.
23097559_5	the lentivirus-mediated knockdown of dicer1 reversed the effects of antogomir-18a, suggesting that mir-18a affected the expression of e-cadherin and k-ras through the regulation of dicer1 .

25203395_3	as shown in figure 2c, all five members of the mir-30 family have one 8-bp conserved target site in the 3'utr of cse.
25203395_4	this strongly led us to believe that the 3'utr of cse could be a target of mir-30 family.
25203395_5	mir-30 suppresses cse expression at both mrna and protein levels, indicating that mir-30 regulates cse expression by promoting mrna degradation.

26159618_1	furthermore, foxq1 was identified as a direct target of mir-1271.
26159618_2	knockdown of foxq1 inhibited gc cell malignant behavior, whereas foxq1 overexpression partially restored the suppression effects of mir-1271.
26159618_3	additionally, mir-1271 expression was negatively correlated with foxq1 in gc tissues.

21731696_1	in contrast to downregulation of the mir-34a targetgenes cmet and axl by overexpression of mir-34a in nsclc cell lines, the intrinsicexpression of cmet and axl was low in sclc cell lines and was not influenced byoverexpression of mir-34a. in summary, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of mir-34a could down-regulate mir-34a targetgenes in cells expressing the target.
21731696_2	we observed an inverse correlation between mir-34a and c-met but not bcl-2 expression in 5 sclc cell lines .
21731696_3	transfection of mir-34a precursor downregulated mrna expression of the axl gene in a549 and nci-h1299 nsclc cells by more than 70% , whereas the mrna expression of the axl gene in nci-h82 and nci-n592 sclc cells was too low to be detected by real-time pcr assay .

23142051_1	in a direct test of endogenous targeting, individual mirna inhibition in metastatic lm2 cells led to an increased target-driven luciferase activity that was abrogated upon mutating the mirna target sites , revealing apoe to be directly targeted by mir-1908 and mir-199a-5p and dnaja4 to be directly targeted by all three mirnas .
23142051_2	these findings establish apoe and dnaja4 as direct targets of these mirnas in melanoma.

22593544_3	since this increase was not observed, these data indicate that mir-146a's ability to regulate pressure-induced cytokine secretion depends on its modulation of both the irak1 and traf6 target.
21339483_1	first, we demonstrated that overexpression of mir-100 represses mtor expression on both the mrna and protein levels in endothelial cells, whereas mir-100 inhibition resulted in a modest but significant upregulation of mtor .
21339483_2	confirming our findings, the binding site of mir-100 in the 3'utr of mtor was characterized and experimentally verified by another group during the course of our study.10
21339483_3	next, we investigated the functional role of mtor in mir-100 signaling.
21339483_4	these data suggest that mir-100 regulates mtor expression not only in vitro but also in vivo . in summary, we demonstrate that mtor is a target of mir-100 in vascular cells and that it conveys its effect on cell proliferation. in addition, the stimulatory effect of antagomir therapy was abolished by simultaneous rapamycin treatment, demonstrating that the therapeutic effect of mir-100 inhibition in hind-limb ischemia is dependent on the intact signaling ability of its target gene mtor.

22733810_4	further, a moderate reduction in map4k4 mrna was detected in pre-mir-30d transfected cells, indicating that the down-regulation of map4k4 by mir-30d was mediated via both translational repression and mrna instability.
22733810_5	this is likely due to the lower level of endogenous mir-30d in min6 cells, and anti-mir-30d only slightly reduced the mir-30d level, which had little effect on the map4k4-wt reporter activity.
22733810_7	the identification of map4k4 as one of mir-30d target describes an important role for mir-30d in protecting -beta-cell function against the inhibitory actions of tnf-alpha.

26152337_1	additionally, one target of mir-1268a was show to be the adamts4 mrna and rs28599926 polymorphism might modify adamts4 expression.
26152337_2	to investigate whether the effects of mir-1268a rs28599926 polymorphism affected the expression of this gene, western blotting analysis was accomplished and proved that mir-1268a-wt can down-regulate adamts4 expression.

21673106_1	of the mirnas identified to target klf4, only mir-143 and mir-145 were induced at least 1.5-fold by both bmp4 and tgf--beta, suggesting that they may be critical for bmp4- and tgf--beta-mediated reduction of klf4.
21673106_2	importantly, a decrease in klf4 mrna was observed concomitant with mir-143 and mir-145 up-regulation with bmp4  tgf--beta stimulation.
21673106_3	under this condition, mir-143 mimic and mir-145 mimic reduced klf4 mrna to -68 and -48% of the endogenous level, respectively , suggesting that mir-145 is a more potent regulator of klf4 in comparison with mir-143.
21673106_5	to further confirm the direct association of mir-145 with the 3'utr of klf4, the predicted the mir-145 binding site in the human klf4 3'utr was cloned into a luciferase reporter vector.
21673106_6	overexpression of mir-145, but not a control mirna mimic, repressed expression of the wt klf4 binding site reporter .

23757351_3	mir-223 over-expressing cells exhibited an aggressive phenotype; however, they were also more sensitive to dna-damaging agents due to the direct interaction between mir-223 and parp1.
23757351_4	high endogenous levels of mir-223 in eacs were significantly associated with lower parp1 levels, and those patients might benefit more from treatment with dna-damaging agents.
19270061_2	to understand posttranscriptional regulation of abcg2 and role of micrornas in drug disposition, we found that microrna-328 might readily target the 3'-untranslated region of abcg2 when considering target-site accessibility.
19270061_3	we then noted an inverse relation between the levels of mir-328 and abcg2 in mcf-7 and mcf-7 mx100 breast cancer cells, and the fact that mir-328 levels could be rescued in mcf-7 mx100 cells transfected with mir-328 plasmid.
19270061_4	luciferase reporter assays showed that abcg2 3'utr-luciferase activity was decreased over 50% in mcf-7 mx100 cells after transfected with mir-328 plasmid, the activity was increased over 100% in mcf-7 cells transfected with a mir-328 antagomir, and disruption of mir-328 response element within abcg2 3'utr led to a 3-fold increase in luciferase activity.
19270061_5	furthermore, the level of abcg2 protein was down-regulated when mir-328 was over-expressed, and the level was up-regulated when mir-328 was inhibited by selective antagomir.
19270061_7	lastly, mir-328-directed down-regulation of abcg2 expression in mcf-7 mx100 cells resulted in an increased mitoxantrone sensitivity, as manifested by a significantly lower ic50 value when compared to the control .
19270061_8	together, these findings suggest that mir-328 targets abcg2 3'utr and consequently, controls abcg2 protein expression and influences drug disposition in human breast cancer cells.

18199536_1	significantly, mir-214 induces cell survival and cisplatin resistance through targeting the 3'-untranslated region of the pten, which leads to down-regulation of pten protein and activation of akt pathway.
18199536_5	immunoblotting and rt-pcr analyses revealed that pten protein but not mrna was considerably decreased in mir-214-ransfected hiose-80 cells . in contrast, knockdown of mir-214 by 2'-o-me mir-214 in a2780cp cells, which express high levels of endogenous mir-214 , increased the protein level of pten .
18199536_6	further, the phosphorylation levels of akt, a major target of pten , and akt substrates glycogen synthase kinase 3' and p70s6k were elevated by ectopic expression of mir-214 and decreased by knockdown of mir-214 , suggesting that mir-214 target the pten akt pathway.
18199536_7	inverse correlation of expression of pten and mir-214 was investigated in primary ovarian tumor specimens. of the 30 primary ovarian tumors examined, 13 exhibited down-regulation of pten and 17 had overexpression of mir-214 .

17416635_1	by western blot analysis, down-regulations of caspase 3 were observed in cudr transfectants.
17416635_4	results support an idea that the protective effect of cudr on doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in a431 cells may be related to its effect on the down-regulation of caspase 3 rather than on the process of drug-induced caspase 3 activation.

26244545_5	we found that mir-126-3p overexpression significantly decreased luciferase activity as compared to the negative control , suggesting that mir-126-3p directly targets the 3'utr region of adam9 and slc7a5 in thyroid cancer cells.
26244545_6	we next analyzed whether there was an association between mir-126-3p expression and adam9 and slc7a5 mrna expression in the tcga papillary thyroid cancer dataset, and found a significant inverse association with slc7a5 mrna expression but not with adam9 mrna expression.

20682640_1	transfection of mir-1 resulted in a downregulation of timp3 mrna by 46%, whereas transfection of mir-206 downregulated timp3 mrna by 78%.
20682640_2	co-transfection of the two micrornas did not alter timp3 mrna downregulation to levels seen with mir-206 alone .

26770408_2	furthermore, mir-525-5p was identified and characterized to interact with 3'utr of adamts13; thereby, mir-525-5p antagomir was capable of upregulating adamts13 expression that might protect neurons from ischemia-induced cell death.
26770408_3	collectively, these data indicate that adamts13 is a potential target of mir-525-5p.
26770408_4	this is consistent with the idea that an ischemia-induced reduction in mir-525-5p negatively regulates adamts13 expression.
23166305_1	mir-145 negatively regulates the expressionand function of p-gp through the repression of mrna by direct interaction on the 3'utr of mdr1 mrna. in the present study, we focused on the decreased mir-145 in the small intestine after liver i r because the 3'utr of mdr1 as well as mdr1a mrna have a potential mir-145 target site as predicted by in silico analysis . the results from the luciferase assays using mdr1 3'utr reporter plasmid in hek293 cells and the downregulation of mir-145 in caco-2 cells demonstrated that mir-145 negatively regulates the expression and function of p-gp through the repression of mrna by direct action on the 3'utr of mdr1 mrna .

20444872_1	after showing that hoxa9 up-regulated mir-155, and that mir-155 mediates at least some figure 2.mir-155 expression is highest in bm stem cell pools, mir-155 is downstream of hoxa9, and mir-155 down-regulates pu.1.
20444872_2	functionality, we used the available prediction programs to identify pu.1 as a putative target for mir-155 .
20444872_4	to test the effects of mir-155 on pu.1 expression, we generated a retroviral vector that expressed a mir-155 hairpin precursor.
20444872_5	although this vector produced an ～600-fold increase in mir-155 in 293t cells , mir-155 expression increased only 8-fold following viral infection of wild-type bm cells .
20444872_6	infection of either wild-type or hoxa9-deficient bm cells with this mir-155 expression vector resulted in an ～50% decrease in pu.1 protein , a finding that has been reported by others since the inception of this work .

26303523_2	the direct interaction of mir-195 and smad7 mrna was investigated using a biotinylated mir-195 pull-down assay.
26303523_3	overexpression of a mir-195 precursor lowered cellular levels of smad7 protein; conversely, antagonism of mir-195 enhanced smad7 translation without disturbing smad7 mrna levels.
26303523_4	a luciferase reporter assay revealed a repressive effect of mir-195 via a single smad7 3'utr target site, and point mutation of this site prevented mir-195-induced repression of smad7 translation.
20018894_2	luciferase activity was significantly decreased by the overexpression of mir-34a, but not by mir-24.
20018894_3	these results suggested that mir-24 and mir-34a down-regulate the hnf4alpha expression by different mechanisms, i.e. mrna degradation and translational repression, respectively.
20018894_4	these results support that mir-24 and mir-34a down-regulate the hnf4alpha expression through recognizing the elements in the coding region and the 3'utr of hnf4alpha mrna, respectively.
20018894_5	this was accompanied by increases of the mature mir-24 and mir-34a levels .
20018894_7	it was considered that pma or h2o2 repressed the hnf4alpha expression though increasing the mir-24 and mir-34a levels.
25480586_1	taken together, these data suggest that mir-101 may inhibit proliferation of saos-2 cells by targeting mtor.
22407479_4	since the 3'utr region from chip mrna is specifically targeted by mir-764-5p, we reason that the inhibition of the wt luciferase reporter is due to the expression of mir-764-5p during the osteoblast differentiation.
25123132_1	kd of mir-146a caused decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, effectively ablating the effects of p53 loss.

21400511_2	based on our qrt-pcr detection and correlation analysis, mir-204 and foxc1 expressions were inversely related in eecs.
21400511_4	we conclude that mir-204 regulates foxc1 expression through interaction with bs1 and bs2.
21400511_6	combined with our substantial evidence on mir-204 inversely regulated foxc1 expression, we propose that mir-204-regulation of migration of eec cells is mediated to a large extent through downregulation of foxc1

25976060_1	using the luciferase reporter system, we then detected that mir-124 directly binds the mrna encoding bim.
25976060_2	indeed, cells transfected with mir-124 mimics induced a reduction in luciferase activity . in our study, we found that downregulating bim by mir-124 or si-bim rna reduced bax translocation to lysosomal membrane in mpp+-intoxicated cells .
25416050_1	mir-363 sensitizes cisplatin-induced apoptosis targeting in mcl-1 in breast cancer.
26138477_1	these striking similarities between deltartl1 and deltamir-127 deltartl1 placentae suggest that mir-127 specifically acts upstream of rtl1 during placental development.

26799586_4	our results demonstrated that mir-1296 directly targets the 3'utr of ccnd1.
22300508_1	forkhead box proteins are a family of important transcription factors and foxo1 is a target of mir-182.
22300508_2	figure 7. foxo1 is a target of mir-182 in the mouse cho cells were transfected with the pcdna3.1-mir-182
22300508_4	as the 3'utr of foxo1 is inserted downstream of the luciferase orf, specific binding to mir-182 prevents luciferase reporter gene expression ; however, mutation of the foxo1 binding site decreases specific binding to mir-182 and restores luciferase activity indicating that mousefoxo1 is a target of mir-182.
22300508_6	thus, there is a concomitant increase in mir-182 expression and a posttranscriptional decrease in foxo1 in both cardiomyocytes and cd3+ t cells posttransplant.

20080624_2	atm mrna levels were measured by quantitative real-time pcr and were not decreased in the presence of mir-421 , suggesting that mir-421 down-regulates atm at a translational rather than transcriptional level.
20080624_3	taken together, these amo-atm experiments suggest that the effect of mir-421 on the cell cycle s-phase checkpoint and radiosensitivity is mediated through atm.
22995917_1	of the mrna targets and mir mimic combinations tested, pdgfra mrna levels were significantly down-regulated by mimics for mir-130b and -218, and cpeb4 mrna levels were reduced following electroporation of let-7b mimics .

26822433_3	one was to express the 3'utr of pten gene which includes mir-29 binding domain .the
26822433_4	other was to express a mutated pten 3'utr sequence without mir-29 binding domain .
26822433_5	suggesting that pten is the downstream target of mir-29.

22551553_2	mir-146a upregulation and notch1 repression were determined to be responsible for the reduced il-12p70 production in tlr9-triggered wild-type dcs compared with that in cd11b-deficient dcs.
22551553_3	therefore, cd11b and downstream mir-146a may be new negative regulators for dc cross-priming by suppressing notch1 expression and il-12p70 production.
22551553_4	to verify whether notch1 3'utr was directly targeted by mir-146a, we constructed a reporter plasmid containing notch1 3'utr and found that its expression was inhibited by mir-146a cotransfection, whereas the seed region-mutated construct failed to be inhibited by mir-146a expression .
22551553_5	this result suggests that notch1 is directly targeted by mir-146a.
22551553_6	together with the result that cpg-odn enhances mir-146a expression in wild-type dcs and mir-146a enhancement is abolished in cd11b-deficient dcs, these data further confirm that cd11b represses cpg-odn-搕riggered il-12p70 production in dcs via upregulating mir-146a and targeting notch1.

20816961_1	furthermore, as shown by western blot , knockdown of mir-24 using anti-mir-24 lna increased the protein level of dnd1 in um2 cells.
20816961_2	similarly, cdkn2a, a known target of mir-24 , was also up-regulated by anti-mir-24 lna treatment.
20816961_3	in contrast, ectopic transfection of mir-24 reduced the protein levels of both dnd1 and cdkn2a in um2 cells .
21376256_1	there was a significant increase in luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type prl-tk plasmid, in contrast to those transfected with the mutant one, indicating that mir-21 promotes bcl-2 expression by binding directly to the 3'utr of bcl-2 mrna.
26079878_1	we discovered that higher mrna level of mir-138 and reduced expression of sirt1 were observed in smcs separated from db db mice and in smc lines c-12511.
26079878_2	moreover, luciferase report assay showed that the activity of sirt1 3' -utr was highly increased by mir-138 inhibitor and reduced by mir-138 mimic.
26079878_3	taken together, these findings indicated that mir-138 could regulate the expression of sirt1 in smcs.
26564600_2	these data indicated that stk35 is a direct target of mir-377.
22721728_1	bioinformatics' algorithms predicted mir-195 binding sites within the beta-site app cleaving enzyme 1 3'-untranslated region , and we found the level of mir-195 to be negatively related to the protein level of bace1 in samp8 mice.
22721728_2	thus, we demonstrated that mir-195 could downregulate the level of a-beta by inhibiting the translation of bace1.
22721728_3	these results suggest that mir-195 might regulate the bace1 mrna translation or decay process, through binding site 1 .
22721728_5	these data together indicate that mir-195 negatively regulates bace1 translation and a production in vitro.
22449978_1	we also confirmed that oncogenic tnks2 is directly upregulated by mir-20a. in addition, tnks2 is positively regulated by mir-20a and similarly promotes migration and invasion in hela and c-33a cells.
22449978_2	these results suggested that mir-20a could directly bind to the 3'utr and specifically promote the expression of tnks2.
22449978_3	these data revealed that mir-20a can positively regulate tnks2 mrna and protein expression.
22449978_4	together, these data suggest that mir-20a modulates the translation of tnks2 mrna via binding sites in its 3'utr and promotes the expression of tnks2 mrna and protein in hela and c-33a cells.
21164520_1	western blot and 3'utr reporter assays confirmed runx2 as a direct target of mir-335 in hmscs.
21164520_2	a western blot analysis of runx2 demonstrated that its protein levels are reduced in hmscs by mir-335 exogenous overexpression .
21164520_3	to determine whether mir-335 directly modulates runx2 expression levels in hmscs, we cloned the full-length runx2 3'utr downstream of the renilla luciferase gene as a reporter, and assayed its expression in hmscs transfected with a synthetic precursor or a specific inhibitor of mir-335.
21164520_4	these results indicate that mir-335 controls runx2 expression in hmscs by direct binding to its 3'utr.
21164520_5	the results of these experiments showed a significant reduction of runx2 expression levels in the cells transduced with the lentiviral vector encoding mir-335, compared with those transduced with a control lentiviral vector, which is in good agreement with the rest of the data indicating that runx2 is a target of mir-335 in hmscs.
21927029_1	a 3'utr reporter assay in hek-293t cells also showed that among these three putative targets, only the foxp1 reporter was significantly repressed by mir-504 .
21927029_2	a similar result was obtained from the same experiment performed in sas cells , suggesting the foxp1 as an important target of mir-504 in ctgf regulation machinery.
21927029_3	collectively, these data support that suppression of mir-504 by ctgf, resulting in upregulation of foxp1 expression contributes to ctgf-mediated inhibition of oscc invasiveness.
25645685_2	here, we found that amp-activated protein kinase and creb are oppositely regulated in mouse primary hippocampal neurons impaired by hypoxia-hypoglycemia. ampk overexpression reduced the creb level by upregulating sirt1 and was negatively posttranscriptionally regulated by mir-134, suggesting a negative regulatory role of ampk in the expression of creb.
19738602_3	a prostate cancer xenograft model revealed that atelocollagen could efficiently deliver synthetic mir-16 to tumor cells on bone tissues in mice when injected into tail veins. in the therapeutic bone metastasis model, injection of mir-16 with atelocollagen via tail vein significantly inhibited the growth of prostate tumors in bone.
19738602_4	cell model studies indicate that mir-16 likely suppresses prostate tumor growth by regulating the expression of genes such as cdk1 and cdk2 associated with cell-cycle control and cellular proliferation.
22991213_2	the tumor-suppressive mir-125b served as a negative regulator of suv39h1. in conclusion, we identified suv39h1 as an important oncogene in hcc, and aberrant suv39h1 up-regulation was partly attributed to the under expression of mir-125b.
22991213_3	suv39h1 was negatively regulated by mir-125b in human hcc.
22991213_4	taken together, our data suggested that suv39h1 up-regulation is contributed by the underexpression of mir-125b in hcc.
22991213_5	furthermore, mir-125b-overexpressing hcc cells showed a profound reduction of endogenous suv39h1 expression at both messenger rna and protein levels .
22267480_1	knockdown of mir-92a stimulated expression of klf4 protein, but expression of klf2 protein remained unchanged .
22267480_2	however, knock-in of mir-92a suppressed transcript expression and protein expression of both klf4 and klf2.
22267480_3	overexpression of mir-92a precursors, but not the scrambled sequence, significantly inhibited the activity of klf4 3'utr- or klf2 3'utr-containing luciferase in hek 293 cells without effect on the control luciferase.
22267480_4	collectively, the data demonstrate the presence of functional mir-92a binding site in the 3'-utrs of both human klf4 and klf2.
22267480_5	the sensitivity to mir-92a of the less evolutionarily conserved binding site identified in the 3'utr of klf4 suggests an additive contribution to klf4 regulation.
22267480_6	renilla luciferase with putative let-7b binding sites cloned from lin-24 3'utr was unresponsive to mir-92a knock-in .
22267480_7	moreover, the functional assay demonstrated the responsiveness of the less evolutionarily conserved mir-92a putative binding element, consistent with measurements in constructs expressing human klf4 full-length 3'utr.
26554827_1	stable expression of mir-885-5p causes severely reduced igf1r transcript levels compared with cells expressing mir-scr .
26554827_2	to support direct suppression, we cloned 3'utr fragments of igf1r mrna containing the mir-885-5p-responsive elements at position 1407-1414, 1833-1839 , and 6965-6971 into reporter plasmid and examined luciferase activity .
26554827_3	increasing amounts of mir-885-5p clearly blocked reporter activity regulated by both 3'utr elements, demonstrating a strong inhibitory effect of mir-885-5p on igf1r expression.
26554827_4	together, these results provide a molecular mechanism that is responsible for inhibition of igf1r by tap73, and indicate that dnp73 activates igf1r signaling via suppression of the tap73-mir-885-5p axis.
20338660_2	col1a2 was experimentally validated as a direct target of let-7g.
20338660_3	moreover, addition of col1a2 counteracted the inhibitory effect of let-7g on cell migration.
20338660_6	taken together, these results indicate that let-7g directly target col1a2, and that a single site within col1a2 mrna is sufficient for let-7g-mediated gene silencing.
26498692_1	in addition, we identified ppm1f as a direct target of mir-149 whose expression was negatively correlated with the expression of mir-149 in hcc tissues.
26498692_2	to conclude, our data indicate that mir-149 negatively regulates the expression of ppm1f by directly targeting its 3'utr.
26498692_3	to further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism by which mir-149 is involved in hcc metastasis, we predicted the putative targets of mir-149 using bioinformatics and validated that ppm1f is a direct downstream mediator of mir-149 through luciferase reporter and western blot assays.
26506238_1	dhfr is a downstream target of mir-192

25482402_2	these data indicate that mir-200a may negatively regulate macc1 expression by directly targeting its 3'utr.
25060662_1	going along with this systemic treatment with mir-144 increased p-akt, p-gsk3-beta and p-p44 42 mapk, decreased p-mtor level and induced autophagy signaling, and induced early and delayed cardioprotection with improved functional recovery and reduction in infarct size similar to that achieved by ripc.
26477824_1	transfection with pre-mir-92a caused down-regulation of itga5 and mek4 mrnas almost 3 and 2 folds, respectively, whereas transfection with anti-mir-92a did not significantly affect their mrnas
20514397_1	we also show that mir-1226 interacts with the muc1 mrna 3'utr and that mir-1226 downregulates endogenous muc1 protein levels.

26738864_1	overexpression of mir-488 suppressed the pax6 mrna expression in hgc-27 cell.
26738864_2	moreover, we also demonstrated that the ectopic expression of mir-488 inhibited the protein expression of pax6.
20236612_2	here we show for the first time that in s-ibm muscle biopsies, bace1-as transcript is significantly increased and is accompanied by an increase of bace1 mrna.
20236612_3	our present findings suggest that the increased bace1 protein results, at least partially, from the increased transcription of bace1 mrna, quite likely driven by bace1-as.
25071021_1	herg1 is a direct target of mir-96 in pancreatic cancer cell lines.

25503932_1	in vitro assays showed that egfr and raf-1 are direct targets of mir-7, which potently suppressed the proliferation of crc cells, and, interestingly, that the growth inhibitory effect of each of these was enhanced by cetuximab.
25503932_2	binding of mir-7 to the 3'utr of egfr mrna and the 3'utr of raf-1 mrna was analyzed by using a luciferase assay.

26864305_3	transfection of hpaec with mir-223 decreased the mrna levels of hdac2 to 0.86 卤 0.15 p' 0.099 whereas mir-223 inhibition significantly increased mrna levels of hdac2 by 1.08 卤 0.036-fold p' 0.007 as compared to control cells.
26485754_1	mir-744 activates wnt/-beta-catenin pathway by targeting sfrp1, gsk3-beta, and tle3.
26485754_2	however, neither mir-744 overexpression nor mir-744 inhibition has effect on the mrna levels of sfrp1, gsk3-beta, and tle3, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of mir-744 on sfrp1, gsk3-beta, and tle3 was regulated at the post-transcriptional level.
26485754_3	mir-744 directly targets sfrp1, gsk3-beta and tle5.
25654102_2	ppp2r2a was a functionally important target of mir-136 and was involved in the tgf--beta1 regulated proliferation of hacat cells.

23083446_3	this suggests that mir-181b, predicted to bindto multiple mres within the 3'utr of e2f1, is able to indirectly influence e2f1-regulated genes as a secondary consequence of e2f1's own regulation by mir-181b.

23125370_1	hypoxia-induced up-regulation of mir-210 was highly correlated with the down-regulation of a group of mitosis-related genes, including plk1, cdc25b, cyclin f, bub1b and fam83d.
23125370_3	we found that hypoxia-induced up-regulation of mir-210 was highly correlated with the down-regulation of plk1, cdc25b, cyclin f, bub1b and fam83d genes involved in mitotic regulation.
23125370_4	mir-210 suppressed the expression of these genes by directly targeting their 3 '-untranslated regions . in contrast, inhibition of endogenous mir-210 with specific mirna inhibitor could reverse the down-regulation of plk1, bub1b, cyclin f, pds5b and cdc25b by hypoxic stress, suggesting that these genes might be mir-210 targets .
23125370_5	it was shown that over-expression of mir-210 also down-regulated the protein expression of plk1, cyclin f, bub1b, cdc25b and fam83d in both hela and cne cells in normal culture condition .

18367714_1	here we show that human mir-148 represses dna methyltransferase 3b gene expression through a region in its coding sequence.
18367714_2	this region is evolutionary conserved and present in the dnmt3b splice variants dnmt3b1, dnmt3b2, and dnmt3b4, but not in the abundantly expressed dnmt3b3. the expression of mir-148a affects the mrna stability of dnmt3b1, but not dnmt3b3, leading to a relative increase in the abundance of dnmt3b3 compared with dnmt3b1 and all other dnmt3b splice variants that express the targeted site.
18367714_4	as expected from the sequence similarity between mir-148a and mir-148b, a similar reduction of gfp-dnmt3b1 expression in cells expressing mir-148b was observed .
18367714_5	these results suggest that the presence of mir-148 represses the expression of dnmt3b1. in conclusion, we present evidence for a functional interaction of human mir-148 with the dnmt3b1 cds. it would be interesting to see whether mirna-mediated regulation of protein coding regions turn out to be a common theme in mirna targeting of mammalian mrnas or the exception that confirms the rule.

22426647_1	overexpression of mir-155 significantly reduced the protein levels of smad2 and repressed the activity of a luciferase reporter containing one of the two predicted mir-155 binding sites in smad2 3'utr, indicating that smad2 may be a mir-155 target gene.
22426647_2	taken together, these data suggest that mir-155 may function as a tumor suppressor to regulate gastric cancer cell metastasis by targeting smad2.

22426647_4	taken together, our data suggest that mir-155 may attenuate the expression of smad2 by directly targeting the 3'utr of smad2.
22426647_5	we showed that only the 8-mer site contributed to mir-155 repressing actions on the 3'utr of smad2; similar results were obtained in a recent study on mir-155 targeting smad2 in macrophages.
22821679_1	in addition to the known target p27 and p57, we identify aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator messenger rna as a novel target of mir-221, which contributes to the pro-proliferative activity of mir-221.

22294637_2	these results demonstrated that mir-199a and mir-101_3 both bindthe seed sequence present in the 3'utr of human cox-2 mrna, but the inhibitory effect on luciferase activity was more pronounced for mir-199a*.
22294637_3	this suggests an indirect effect of mir-101_3 on the post-transcriptional regulation of cox-2 expression in oa chondrocytes.
22294637_4	these data suggest that il-1-beta-induced activation of p38-mapk negatively regulates the expression of mir-199a which may be necessary for the unobstructed translation of cox-2 mrna and expression of cox-2 protein in human oa chondrocytes.

21435336_4	as shown by qrt-pcr and immunocytochemistry, overexpression of mature hsa-mir-381 in u251 lrrc4+ cells resulted in the down-regulation of lrrc4 at the mrna transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels .

22874921_3	we then validated in vivo one of the identified target, foxp2, and found that convergent action of mir-9 and mir-132 prevents ectopic expression of foxp2 by targeting its 3'utr.
21460851_1	to determine the target gene controlled by mir-27a, we first searched three algorithm programs to predict the targets of mir-27a.
21460851_2	to compare the binding affinity of mir-27a with these four genes-mrnas including foxo1, prohibitin, zbtb10 and fbxw7, we used a dual-luciferase reporter system to examine their luciferase activity.
21460851_4	however, the affinity of fbxw7 mrna with mir-27a is of the highest with 50% luciferase activity suppression compared with nc treatment, while other three showed 30-37% activity suppression.
21460851_5	these observations indicate that fbxw7 is also an important target of mir-27a.
21460851_6	the results showed that the level of fbxw7 mrna in hbelh cells transfected with 200 nm mir-27a mimic was decreased by 60% compared with mimic nc measured by quantitative rt-揚cr, indicating that mir-27a regulates fbxw7 expression by mrna degradation .
21460851_7	thus, we further confirm that fbxw7 is one of the targets of mir-27a.
22406815_1	mir-217 is involved in tat-induced hiv-1 long terminal repeat transactivation by down-regulation of sirt1. in addition, mir-217 significantly inhibited sirt1 protein expression by acting on the 3'utr of the sirt1 mrna. in addition, mir-217 significantly inhibited sirt1 protein expression by acting on the 3'utr of the sirt1 mrna.
22406815_2	taken together, these data suggest that mir-217 reduces the efficiency of sirt1 mrna translation, rather than the abundance of the sirt1 mrna, by acting on a response element located in the sirt1 3'utr.
22406815_3	we performed in silico studies to predict downstream target of mir-217 and used functional assays to confirm that mir-217 downregulated sirt1 by directly acting on the sirt1 mrna.

26893657_1	previous studies have demonstrated that erbb2 is a target gene of mir-375 , that the pi3k akt signal pathway is associated with erbb2 regulation, and that the activation of the erbb2 pi3k akt signal pathway may promote drug resistance ; however, to the best of our knowledge, whether mir-375 alters the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to ddp via regulation of the erbb2 pi3k akt pathway is unknown.
26893657_2	western blotting demonstrated that upregulation of mir-375 expression levels in the sgc7901 ddp cells markedly decreased the protein expression levels of erbb2 and p-akt, as compared with the mir-control and sgc7901 ddp parental cells .
26893657_3	these results suggest that overexpression of mir-375 may sensitize sgc7901 ddp cells to the effects of ddp via inactivation of the erbb2 pi3k akt pathway.
21187093_2	although the pten 3'utr is not a perfect match to the seed sequence of mir-21 because there was a g:u pair , a previous study showed that pten is a mir-21 targetin cholangiocarcinoma cell lines .
21187093_3	we thus hypothesized that pten is a direct mir-21 targetin k562 cells.
21187093_4	these results show that pten is a target of mir-21, and that overexpression of mir-21 activates the pi3k akt pathway by decreasing the pten protein level.
25582055_1	among the validated mir-21 target genes, pdcd4 plays an important role in cancer cell migration . in our previous study, we showed that adar2 inhibits glioblastoma cell migration .

26297545_1	based on conserved sequences in 3'utr for mir-99b binding, we identified the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor gene as a direct target for mir-99b.
26297545_2	our results demonstrate that mir-99b is decreased in ca samples compared to that in normal skin, and mir-99b plays a role in cell proliferation by targeting igf-1r, which regulates the pi3k akt signaling pathway.
26297545_3	such significant decrease in reporter activity was not seen when the reporter was in the vector containing the mutant igf-1r 3'utr , in spite of the presence of mi-r99b, indicating that sequences in the 5602- 5607 bp region of the igf-1r 3'utr indeed interact with mir-99b, inhibiting expression of igf-1r.
26134491_1	egfr was selected from several putative mir-133a target genes, since igf-1r has been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis .
26134491_3	5a, mir-133a contains two predicted binding sites in the 3'utr of egfr mrna.
26134491_5	to determine whether mir-133a affects the regulation of endogenous efgr, we transiently reintroduced the mir-133a mimic into hela cells.
26134491_6	we found that ectopic expression of mir-133a markedly reduced egfr protein expression in the hela cells , suggesting that egfr is a bona fide target of mir-133a.

26309499_2	collectively, inhibition of mir-155 suppresses cell migration in npc through targeting zdhhc2.
26309499_4	in our study, we found that mir-155 inhibitor could increase endogenous zdhhc2 protein expression in npc cne1 and tw03 cells, and luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify zdhhc2 as direct targets of mir-155.
26318298_1	we observed that mir-335 has a putative binding site in the 3'utr of birc5. in both hek 293 t and sgc-7901 cells,mir-335 could only significantly weaken the relative luciferase activity of the reporter carrying wide-type sequences, but not the mutant construct.
22294552_1	downregulation of tumor suppressive mir-1285, which target oncogenic genes including tgm2, might contribute to rcc development.
22294552_3	furthermore, both tgm2 mrna and tgm2 protein expression levels were markedly downregulated in mir-1285 transfectants in comparison with the control transfectants .
22294552_4	our data indicated that upregulation of oncogenic tgm2 may be due to downregulation of tumor suppressive mir-1285 in human rcc progression.

22833211_3	neutralization of endogenous mir-16 by direct injection of anti-mir-16 in the hippocampus increased the levels of sert and bcl-2 and the number of dcx-positive cells, similarly to fluoxetine injection in the raphe .
22071331_2	similarly, transfection of mir-125b inhibitor into hbecs increased 4e-bp1 protein expression .
22071331_3	however, no significant change of 4e-bp1 mrna level was found after transfection of mir-125b mimic or inhibitor , suggesting that mir-125b can interfere with 4e-bp1 mrna translation but not degradation.
22071331_4	taken together, these results verified that 4e-bp1 mrna is a direct target of mir-125b.
22071331_5	however, knockdown of 4e-bp1 gene with sirna could abolish the effect of mir-125b on the further induction of ifn-alpha/-beta in beas-2b cells, which indicates that the effect of mir-125b was specifically caused by targeting of 4e-bp1 mrna.
22071331_6	the 4e-bp1 protein expression levels inversely correlated with mir-125 levels in sinonasal mucosa .

21602190_3	the expression levels of ezh2 and cfos, other targets of mir-101a , were not significantly altered at the mrna level but substantially increased at the protein level .
21602190_4	the increase in the protein amount without a significant change in the rna amount indicated that ezh2 and cfos were regulated post-transcriptionally in the liver of the mice.
25263437_1	to furthermore determine whether extracellular timp-1 is sufficient to induce mir-210 upregulation, we incubated a549l with recombinant timp-1 in a concentration similar to timp-1 levels in lung cancer patients 13 or with medium conditioned by timp-1 overexpressing cells.
25263437_2	we found significant upregulation of mature mir-210 as well as pri-mir-210 upon extracellular timp-1 stimulation which suggests a paracrine mode-of-action by which timp-1 can induce mir-210 in a549l adenocarcinoma cells.
25263437_3	we could also verify the underlying concept as a knockdown of timp-1 led to a reduction of pri-mir-210 and mir-210 in a human ovarian carcinoma cell line as well as a decrease of primir-210 in a549l lung adenocarcinoma cells.
25263437_4	we could show that timp-1-induced increase of mir-210 levels were sufficient to trigger its regulative role and to decrease mir-210 targets.

26744864_1	moreover, mir-26b was found to negatively regulate cox-2 protein level by directly targeting its 3'utr.
26744864_2	in addition, we found cox-2 is a potential target of mir-26b.
26744864_3	these results suggest that mir-26b can specifically bind to the 3'utr of cox-2.
26744864_4	taken together, these results indicate cox-2 is a direct downstream target of mir-26b in lung cancer cells.
23139153_1	direct interaction between mir-197 and p120 catenin mrna sequence was confirmed by 3'utr assay, and knockdown of p120 catenin recapitulated emt induction in pancreatic cancer cells.

23139153_3	based on these results, we concluded that p120 catenin is a direct target of mir-197.
23139153_4	these results indicate that attenuated expression of p120 catenin in ida could be explained by increased mir-197 expression to certain extent.
20347499_1	over-expression of let-7c or let-7g led to a clear decrease of bcl-xl expression in huh7 and hepg2 cel lines.
20347499_2	reporter assays revealed direct post-transcriptional regulation involving let-7c or let-7g and the 30-untranslated region of bcl-xl mrna.
20347499_3	let-7c and let-7g downregulate bcl-xl expression by directly targeting the 3'utr of bcl-xl mrna. in conclusion, we have demonstrated that let-7 mirna negatively regulates bcl-xl expression in hccs.
20347499_4	a single base mutation prevented the downregulation of firefly luciferase induced by let-7c or let-7g, which strongly suggests a direct inhibitory effect of let-7 on bcl-xl expression .
20347499_5	these results are consistent with the hypothesis that let-7 mirnas negatively regulate bcl-xl expression independent of transcriptional regulation.

22964638_3	we demonstrate that mir-30b c and mir-21 target respectively the 3' untranslated region of caspase-3 and tap63 mrnas, and that those proteins mediate some of the effects of mir-30 and -21 on trail resistance, even in human glioblastoma primary cells and in lung cancer cells.
26647742_1	programmed cell death 10 is the direct target of mir-425-5p which is required for the regulatory role of mir-425-5p in chemoresistance.
26647742_2	we provided evidence that mir-425-5p can directly modulate chemoresistance in these cells by regulating the expression level of its downstream target pdcd10 both in vitro and in vivo.
26647742_3	as shown in figure 4e, cotransfection of mir-425-5p precursor with wild-type pdcd103 0 -utr reporter construct significantly repressed relative luciferase activity, whereas mutation of the mir-425-5p-binding site eliminated this effect, supporting that pdcd10 is a direct target of mir-425-5p in crc cells.

22484852_3	all these results indicated that mir-22 exert inhibitory effects on erbb3 expression via interaction with the 3'utr of erbb3.
22484852_4	additionally, over-expression of erbb3 in a549 and h1299 cells significantly prevents the inhibitory effects of mir-22 on proliferation and invasion.

20036862_1	thus, our results indicate that mir-124 regulates the expression of hes-1 at the post-transcriptional level and is involved in the retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation of p19 cells.
20036862_2	these results suggest that the expression of mir-124 might be associated with the differentiation of p19 cells. in addition, it is possible that a relationship exists between mir-124 and hes-1. in contrast, the level of hes-1 protein increased in the presence of lna-mir-124 ; however, the level of hes-1 mrna was unchanged .
20036862_3	these results strengthen our hypothesis that mir-124 regulates the expression of hes-1.
14685240_1	lsy-6 exerts its effects on asel through repression of cog-1.
24305048_1	here we show that hmga2 promotes lung cancer progression in mouse and human cells by operating as a competing endogenous rna for the let-7 microrna family.
24305048_2	hmga2 can promote the transformation of lung cancer cells independent of protein-coding function but dependent upon the presence of let-7 sites; this occurs without changes in the levels of let-7 isoforms, suggesting that hmga2 affects let-7 activity by altering mirna targeting.

20833636_4	this supports the notion that cdk6 is directly controlled by mirna-107.
20833636_5	in summary, the results indicate that cdk6 and p130 protein levels are under control of mirna-107 but p130 may not be a direct target of this mirna.

17621267_5	taken together, these data indicate that map3k8 is a biologically relevant target of mir-370 and that upregulation of map3k8 is not a general result of promotion of cell proliferation.
25961369_1	a target prediction program, targetscan,showed that mucin 1 may be a potential target of mir-145.

25867061_3	we found that overexpression of mir-621 could significantly decrease the expression of fbxo11 in hct116 wt cells, but not in hct116 dicer-/- cells , suggesting that the repression of fbxo11 by mir-621 is dicer-dependent.
25867061_4	in accordance, mir-621 overexpression significantly repressed the activity of a luciferase reporter fused to fbxo11 3'utr, but not the one fused to fbxo11 3'utr mutant in which mir-621-recognition site was deleted .
25867061_5	all these data strongly support that mir-621 may repress fbxo11 expression through recognition of its binding site within fbxo11 3'utr in human cancer cells.

26840018_2	here, we reported that mir-326 is indeed suppressed in primary lung cancers compared with the matching adjacent normal tissues, and found 3'utr of the human ccnd1 mrna is really a target of mir-326.
26840018_3	these results suggest that mir-326 binds directly to the predicted binding site in the ccnd1 3'utr.
26840018_4	mir-326 targets ccnd1 in lung cancer cells and negatively expressed with ccnd1.
24098322_1	here, we validated tnf-alpha as the target of mir-181a by a dual luciferase assay.
24098322_2	our study provides the first evidence of the role of mir-181a in adipocyte differentiation by regulation of tnf-alpha, which may became a new therapeutic target for anti-obesity drugs. in this study, we demonstrated the ability mir-181a to inhibit tnf-alpha expression by targeting the 3'utr of its mrna, thus affecting adipogenesis.
24098322_3	thus, tnf-alpha was initially confirmed as the target of mir-181a.
24098322_4	this study demonstrates that mir-181a is a novel regulator of tnf-alpha in porcine adipocytes.
19780876_3	nevertheless, the ppar-alpha protein level decreased and increased significantly after the overexpression and knockdown of mirna-10b, respectively .
19780876_4	thus, these results demonstrated that mirna-10b directly recognized the 3'utr of the ppar-alpha transcript and mediated its expression post-transcriptionally.
22245693_1	hmga1 can be regulated negatively by mir-26a at both transcriptional level and protein level in sw1990 and panc-1 cells.
22245693_3	to validate whether hmga1 is a direct target of mir-26a, we mutated the mir-26a binding site in the 3'utr of hmga1 and observed loss of repression.
23546867_1	together, these results support the hypothesis that mcl-1 is a direct target of mir-193a-3p.
23546867_2	these results together confirm that mcl-1 is a direct target of mir-193a-3p and that the region between 1,585 and 1,591 bp downstream of the stop codon is a targetsequence to which mir-193a-3p bind. in short, the overlap in phenotypes caused by either mcl-1 downregulation or expression of mir-193a-3p, strongly suggest that mcl-1 downregulation is a critical point in mir-193a-3p-induced apoptosis.
23546867_3	together, these observations strongly suggest that mcl-1 downregulation is a critical step during apoptosis triggered by mir-193a-3p.
26287602_1	figue 6: chd5 was a direct target of mir-454.

26239616_4	overexpression of mir-132 significantly reduced the expression levels of mecp2, at both the mrna and protein level, whereas downregulation of mir-132 increased the mrna and protein expression levels of mecp2.
26239616_5	these results indicate that mecp2 and mir-132 may regulate hippocampal bdnf expression in an opposite manner, suggesting that homeostatic interactions between these factors control hippocampal bdnf expression.
26572867_1	here we show post-transcriptional regulation of shank3 expression by three micrornas , mir-7, mir-34a, and mir-504.
26572867_3	together, these results suggest that mir-7, mir-34a, and mir-504 directly bind to the shank3 3'utr and downregulate its expression.
26572867_4	we found that mir-7, mir-34a, and mir-504, three mirnas with altered expression profiles in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, directly regulate shank3 expression.
26647829_1	a luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that mir-145 was able to bind to the 3'-untranslated region of fscn1 mrna.
26647829_2	luciferase activity levels were significantly reduced in ags cells with the wild type 3'utr of fscn1 mrna co-transfected with mir-145 mimics; however, luciferase activity levels did not change in ags cells with mutant type 3'utr of fscn1 mrna co-transfected with mir-145 mimics, compared with the control group , indicating that fscn1 is a direct target gene of mir-145.
26647829_3	therefore, the results suggest that mir-145 negatively regulates the protein expression of fscn1 in ags gastric carcinoma cells, perhaps by directly binding to the 3'utr of fscn1 mrna.
26647829_4	the present study identified fscn1 as a target of mir-145 in gastric carcinoma cells, and demonstrated that mir-145 was downregulated, whereas fscn1 was upregulated in gastric carcinoma cell lines, as compared with normal gastric mucosal epithelial cells.
20826792_1	we presentcompelling evidence that tiam1, a guanidine exchange factor of the rac gtpase, is a direct target of both mir-21 and mir-31.
20826792_2	thus mir-21 and mir-31 appear to control tiam1 expression mainly through repression of the protein translation, not degradation of the mrna.
20826792_4	5, mir-21 and mir-31 also down-regulated tiam1 in dld1 and sw480 cells .
20826792_5	importantly, we found that transfection of mir-21 did not cause a significant change in mature mir-31 level, and vice versa .
20826792_6	therefore, mir-21 and mir-31 do not influence the expression levels of each other and likely impact the expression of tiam1 independently.
20826792_7	this strongly suggests that mir-31 also directly represses tiam1 translation.
20826792_8	these data further substantiate our model that repression of tiam1 is a critical component in mir-21 mir-31 regulation of migratory and invasive properties of lim 1863 cells.

26512958_1	taken together, these data demonstrate that mir-371a-5p enhance bag3 protein expression, and that the interaction of mir-371a-5p with human bag3 3'utr critically depends on the presence of the g2252 variant.
26512958_2	intriguingly, this posttranscriptional pathway regulating bag3 protein expression is altered by the presence of the g2252c variant in the 3'utr of human bag3, which is frequently present in a cohort of ttc patients, suggesting that epi-induced mir-371-5p and bag3 may potentially represent new molecular components in the disease pathogenesis of ttc.

11919683_1	we found that the mouseklhl1as rna is not spliced and terminates in a polyadenylation site in the klhl1 promoter region, whereas both the present and previous work show that human klhl1as is highly variably spliced into processed transcripts that contain up to six exons.
11919683_4	the evolutionary conservation of this antisense sense transcriptional organization strongly indicates that klhl1as transcripts play a significant biological role in both human and mouse presumably as a regulator of klhl1 expression.

25379703_2	overexpression of mir-18a reduced cdc42 expression, and a luciferase assay confirmed that mir-18a directly targets the 3'utr of cdc42.
25379703_3	mir-18a mimics had a similar effect on proliferation as a small molecule inhibitor of cdc42.
25379703_4	inhibition of cdc42 expression is likely to be a key mechanism by which mir-18a impairs cancer cell growth, with a target protector experiment revealing mir-18a influences proliferation via direct inhibition of cdc42.

22367714_2	this data indicated that mir-450b-5p can specifically bind to the 3'utr of pax6 and may inhibit pax6 expression.
22367714_3	as expected, pax6 expression was attenuated by the presence of pre-mir-450b-5p , confirming that pax6 is a target of mir-450b-5p, and indicating that the decrease in the levels of mir-450b-5p is contributing to the induction in pax6 protein expression during early neuroectodermal commitment of hescs .

21592405_3	these data indicate that mir-335 may inhibit the expression of daam1 at posttranscriptional level by directly targeting the 3'utr of daam1 mrna.

22469983_1	further in vitro observations showed that enforced expression of mir-424 inhibited cell growth by both enhancing apoptosis and blocking g1 s transition, and suppressed cell migration and invasion in two human cervical cancer cell lines, siha and caski, implying that mir-424 functions as a tumor suppressor in the progression of cervical cancer.
22469983_2	interestingly, overexpression of mir-424 inhibited the expression of protein checkpoint kinase 1 and phosphorylated chk1 at residues ser345 and decreased the activity of luciferase-reporter containing the 3'-untranslated region of chk1 with predicted mir-424-binding site.
22039399_1	computational target prediction analysis indicated that cxcr4 is one of the consensus putative targets of mir-150 relevant to stem cell mobilization .

22039399_3	as shown in figure 3c, knockdown of mir-150 by anti-mir-150 markedly reduced cxcr4 protein expression in mncs, indicating cxcr4 is a putative target of mir-150 in mncs. in addition, knockdown of mir-150 in mncs by lentiviral vector significantly increased cxcr4 expression .
22039399_4	interestingly, we found that in vivo transplantation of mncs lacking mir-150 expression into the irradiated wild type mice resulted in increased number of mncs in pb released from bm as compared to that of mncs transducing scramble , indicating that mir-150 plays a critical role in mnc mobilization in bm through cxcr4 regulation . in conclusion, our results demonstrated that mir-150 downregulation by ami enhanced cxcr4 expression, leading to enhanced bm-mncs mobilization and migration.

21324893_3	consistent with recent reports that mir-206 and mir-29abc targetthe 3'utr of hdac4.
21324893_4	these data confirm that the hdac4 3'utr is a target of both mir-29 and mir-206 and, more importantly, demonstrate the ability of these mirnas to potently modulate tgf--beta-induced changes in hdac4 expression.
23158364_1	forced over-expression of mir-23a decreased the expression of uvb-induced topoisomerase-1caspase7stk4 at both the mrna and protein levels, and these effects were reversed by down-regulation of mir-23a.

22937097_2	the putative binding sites of mir-124a and mir-181a are the 3'-utrs of dlx5 and msx2 mrnas, respectively.
22937097_3	this was performed with a reporter plasmid, into which the wild-type or mutant-type 3'utr binding sequences of the respective seed regions of mir-124a and mir-181a from dlx5 and msx2 were cloned into the 3'utr of a luciferase gene .
22629385_1	this analysis pinpointed mir-204, mir-211, and mir-379 as such key regulators.
22629385_3	we performed luciferase reporter assays to determine whether mir-204, -211, or -379 inhibit the expression of the luciferase reporter gene by binding to the il11 3'utr sequence.
22629385_4	mir-211 and -379 inhibited the reporter activity of both of the constructs, indicating that they bindto at least two sites in the il11 3'utr .

23510267_1	these data demonstrate that bovine mstn is a specific target of mir-27b and that mirnas contribute to explain additive phenotypic hypertrophy in piedmontese cattle selected for the mstn gene mutation, possibly outlining a more precise genetic signature able to elucidate differences in muscle conformation.
23510267_2	co-transfection of pre-mir-142 with the wild-type mstn 3' -utr construct did not alter the luciferase activity, indicating that mir-27b specifically targeted mstn .
23510267_3	here we demonstrate that mstn is further regulated at post-transcriptional level by mir-27b.
26036635_1	these data suggested that mir-32 targeted aurka and that tanshinones suppressed aurka by regulating the expression levels of mir-32 and other interrelated mirnas.

26549292_2	all these results indicate mir-146b-5p and its downstream target gene znrf3 can be used to treat osteosarcoma chemoresistance in the future.
26549292_3	in conclusion, our investigation revealed that the mir-146b-5p affects migration, invasion and chemoresistance in osteosarcoma possibly via downregulation of znrf3.
24902663_1	pdcd4 was selected for further experimental validation, because the complementary sequence of mir-21 was identified in the 3'utr of pdcd4 mrna by miranda analysis.
24902663_2	moreover cotransfection of 786-o cells with the wt 3'utr and anti-mir-21 reversed the decrease caused by mir-21 .
24902663_4	expression of pdcd4 was significantly reduced by mir-21 transfection and increased by anti-mir-21 transfection , indicating that mir-21 causes a reduction in pdcd4 expression in 786-o cells.
19703993_1	mir-200a was found to directly targetbeta-catenin mrna, thereby inhibiting its translation and blocking wnt beta-catenin signaling, which is frequently involved in cancer.
19703993_2	interestingly, we found that increased levels of mir-200a in meningioma cells significantly downregulated -beta-catenin at both mrna and protein levels .
19703993_3	these data strongly suggest that the reduced -beta-catenin levels in pre-mir-200a-transfected cells is a result of direct targeting of the -beta-catenin rna by mir-200a.
19703993_4	taken together, these data suggest that among mir-200a target, the -beta-catenin mrna is one of the major contributors to mir-200a-induced apoptosis.
23861446_1	thus, mir-7a directly targets the scn2b 3'utr in a sequence-specific manner.
23861446_2	moreover, the mir-7a-binding site is well conserved among mammals , indicating scn2b regulation by mir-7a is functionally important.
19723635_1	mir-206 target and regulates human notch3.
19723635_2	hela cells had minimal endogenous mir-206 expression, which provided a good in vitro cell model system to determine a real interaction between exogenously expressed mir-206 and notch3 and should exclude effects from endogenous mir-206.
19723635_3	next, we determined the inhibitory effect of mir-206 on endogenous human notch3 protein expression using hela cells.
19723635_4	as expected, ectopic expression of mir-206 resulted in a significant reduction of human notch3 protein expression . in addition, the level of human notch3 mrna was also repressed by mir-206 .
19723635_5	overall, the above results identified notch3 as a novel targetgene of mir-206.
26160756_1	transfection of huh-7 cells with mir-1275 suppressed igf2bps expression and all three igf2bps were confirmed as targets of mir-1275.
26160756_2	ectopic expression of mir-1275 and knockdown of igf2bps inhibited malignant cell behaviors, and also reduced igf1r protein and mrna.
26160756_3	finally igf1r was validated as a direct target of mir-1275.
26160756_4	these findings indicate that the tumor-suppressor mir-1275 can control hcc tumor growth partially through simultaneously regulating the oncogenic igf2bps and igf1r.
26160756_5	these findings indicate that mir-1275 directly binds to the 3'utr of igf1r.
23485012_1	the serine threonine kinase mst1, an amplifier of cell apoptosis, seemed to be a target of mir-138, and the activation of the akt pathway was necessary for the anti-apoptotic effect of mir-138.
23485012_2	a marked increase in akt phosphorylation at ser 473 was found in pasmcs overexpressing mir-138, which was blocked by co-transfection with amo-138 , suggesting that mir-138 activates akt signalling by negatively regulating mst1 at the post-transcriptional level.
23485012_3	these data strongly suggest that the akt signalling pathway is involved in the suppression of pasmc apoptosis by mir-138.
23485012_4	these data thus suggest that the mir-138-mediated suppression of caspase-dependent apoptosis appears to target at mst1.
21707582_1	mir203 is a tumour suppressor microrna inhibiting cellular proliferation by targeting creb1 mrna in mm.
21707582_2	creb1 was a common targetpredicted by both of these algorithms, showing an exact match from position 3- 13 of the mature mir203 to the 3'utr of creb1 mrna . in contrast, the luciferase activity of mutant creb1 3'utr construct, with four point mutations introduced to the putative binding site of mir203, showed comparable activity signals with or without mir203 overexpression, suggesting the direct regulation of mir203 on the creb1 3'utr .
21707582_3	finally, upon overexpression of precursor mir203, kms-12-pe and wl-2 showed 20% inhibition of cell proliferation as compared with the negative control precursors at 72 h by mtt assay, thereby suggesting that mir203 inhibited proliferation of myeloma cells via targeting creb1 .
21802413_1	under inhibition of pi3 kinase by ly294002, the suppressive effect of mir-491 on hcv replication was abolished, indicating that suppression of hcv replication by mir-491 was dependent on the pi3 kinase akt pathway.

19011694_1	experimental validation revealed that mir-22 regulated ppara and bmp7 expression and its inhibition blocked inflammatory and catabolic changes in osteoarthritic chondrocytes.
19011694_2	inhibition of mir-22 in osteoarthritic chondrocytes by antisense mir-22 treatment, highly up-regulated bmp-7 and ppara expression, suggesting that mir-22 is a strong regulator of bmp-7 and ppara proteins.
19011694_3	all above data suggest that mir-22 regulates bmp-7 at the mrna level and ppara at the protein level .
20507594_1	we report here that bace1-antisense prevents mirna-induced repression of bace1 mrna by masking the binding site for mir-485-5p.
20507594_2	indeed, mir-485-5p and bace1-antisense compete for binding within the same region in the open reading frame of the bace1 mrna.
20507594_3	our results indicate that mirna-binding sites in the coding parts of mrnas may still be functional and further suggest the possibility of in vivo interactions between mir-485-5p and mature bace1 mrna.
20507594_4	simultaneous over-expression of both bace1-as and mir-485-5p returned the bace1 protein level to the basal level.
20507594_5	these data imply that mir-485-5p and bace1-as may compete for binding to bace1 mrna and support the novel regulatory role of masking a mirna-binding site in bace1 by the non-coding bace1-as transcript.
20507594_6	the high concentration of mir-485-5p and bace1-as in the brain regions suggests the likelihood of their functional interaction with the bace1 mrna targetsite, and involvement in bace1 regulation.
26446987_1	mechanistically, we showed that tat synergized with k1 to induce the expression of mir-891a-5p, which directly targeted ikappabalpha 3' untranslated region, leading to nf-kappab activation.
26446987_2	consequently, inhibition of mir-891a-5p increased ikappabalpha level, prevented nuclear translocation of nf-kappab p65 and ultimately suppressed the synergistic effect of tat- and k1-induced angiogenesis.
26446987_3	our results illustrate that, by targeting ikappabalpha to activate the nf-kappab pathway, mir-891a-5p mediates tat and k1 synergistic induction of angiogenesis.
26446987_4	these data suggest that mir-891a-5p directly targets ikappabalpha.
26446987_5	together these data suggest that mir-891a-5p mediates k1- and tat-induced angiogenesis by targeting ikappabalpha to activate the nf-kappab pathway.
26364844_1	mir-221 and mir-222 can bind the same sequence of reck 3'utr, thereby modulating its expression.
26364844_2	through simultaneous regulation over reck, mir-221 and mir-222 can promote gastric cancer cell growth and invasion.
26364844_3	these results suggest that both mir-221 and mir-222 directly target reck and regulate its expression.
26850728_1	collectively, these results indicated that mir-320a could directly target aqp1 and their interactions would be further verified in a rat ir model.

9774349_2	in this study, we carried out deletion analysis which showed that separate domains of the oxys rna are required for the regulation of fhla and rpos.
9774349_3	we examined oxys repression of fhla and found that the rna inhibits ribosome binding and translation by pairing with a short sequence overlapping the fhla ribosome-binding site.
25312821_1	mir-429 directly targeted notch1 and reduced both mrna and protein levels of notch1 which stimulated proliferation and suppressed apoptosis in hcc cells.
21446014_1	this study also shows that pdef expression is regulated via a functional microrna-204 binding site within the 3'utr.
21446014_2	reciprocal knockdown of endogenous mir-204 levels was performed using antisense oligoribonucleotides targeted against mir-204 in pc3 and du145 cells and resulted in an increase in pdef protein levels, while the pdef mrna levels remained unchanged .
21446014_3	these results demonstrate that mir-204 regulates endogenous pdef mrna at the post-transcriptional level, most likely through a mechanism of translation inhibition.
25575817_1	the mrna and protein levels of pdcd4 were decreased with mir-21 mimics and increased with mir-21 inhibitor treatment .
25575817_2	therefore mir-21 decreased pdcd4 expression in k562 and hl60 cells.
25575817_3	transfection with rbp2 expression plasmid increased mrna and protein levels of pdcd4, and mir-21 mimic treatment reversed the rbp2-overexpression-induced pdcd4 , which suggests that rbp2 increased pdcd4 expression via mir-21.
22144583_1	the sirnas significantly reduced levels of their targetproteins after 24 h, and transfection of mir-200c mimic also led to a significant reduction in both fhod1 and ppm1f protein levels within the same time frame .
22144583_2	conversely, inhibition of mir-200bc 429 cluster mirnas in mcf-7 cells by transfection of microrna hairpin inhibitors increased fhod1 and ppm1f protein levels.
22144583_3	these findings were also validated at the mrna level upon mir-200c overexpression or inhibition , confirming mrna degradation mechanisms for mir-200c targeting of these two genes.
22144583_4	in conclusion, the results of the luciferase assay confirmed that fhod1 and ppm1f are indeed novel direct target of mir-200c.
22144583_5	this suggests that mir-200c might also contribute to the regulation of fhod1 and ppm1f in breast cancer patients.
22144583_6	altogether, these data suggest that targeting of either fhod1 or ppm1f by mir-200c contributes to the effects of mir-200c on migration-related processes.
22438923_1	here we demonstrate that mir-148a and mir-152 down-regulate hla-g expression by binding its 3'utr and that this down-regulation of hla-g affects lilrb1 recognition and consequently, abolishes the lilrb1-mediated inhibition of nk cell killing.
22438923_2	mir-148a and mir-152 potentially targetthe 3'utr of hla-g.
22438923_3	thus, both mir-148 and mir-152 directly targetthe 3'utr of hla-g and such targeting lead to hla-g down-regulation.
22438923_4	these results indicate that the predicted binding sites were indeed targeted by both mir-148a and mir-152 and that the g c polymorphism has no influence on mirna-mediated targeting, despite the unusual seed match.
26752466_1	these results clearly suggest that nod2 is controlled by mir-320.
26752466_2	nod2 is a target of mir-320 family.
26752466_3	these results show that mir-320 a, -b, and -c control nod2 expression.
26752466_4	these results suggest that the downregulation of endogenous mir-320 during inflammation is accountable of the nod2 increased expression.
26752466_5	these results show that, during inflammation, exogenous mir-320 are able to control nod2 expression.
24969479_1	as a result, we conclude that mir-221 may have a crucial role in repressing the expression of caspase-3 which may contribute to a lower apoptotic rate, thus supporting the selection of more aggressive cancer cells.
24969479_2	to our knowledge, this is the first study related to the expression levels of caspase-3 and mir-221 in different cell lines at the same time.
24969479_3	we expect that our study might pave the way for better understanding the role of mir-221 in apoptotic regulation of caspase-3.
22139076_1	here we report that glia-enriched mir-135a, a microrna that is dramatically downregulated in malignant glioma and correlated with the pathological grading, is capable of inducing mitochondria-dependent apoptosis of malignant glioma by regulating various genes including stat6, smad5 and bmpr2, as well as affecting the signaling pathway downstream.
25053708_1	next, we looked for predicted mir-35 family target genes that might play a role in hermaphrodite fecundity downstream of mir-35-41.
25053708_3	multiple 3- utrs have been annotated for the sup-26 mrna , only one of which contains the mir-35 family target site .
25053708_4	for sup-26 to be a direct mir-35 family target, the longest 1146-bp 3'utr must be used.
25053708_5	sup-26 also suppressed the appearance of endomitotic oocytes in mir-35-41 ;sup-26 .
25053708_6	only 6.8% of uteri in mir-35-41 ;sup-26 contained endomitotic oocytes on the first day of gravidity , compared with 47.8% in mir-35-41 .
25053708_7	therefore, the predicted mir-35 family target gene sup-26 functions downstream of mir-35-41 in regulating spermatogenesis at restrictive temperature.
26747707_1	expression of enforced mir-31 significantly enhanced invasion and migration of multiple pancreatic cancer cells resulting from activation of rhoa through regulation of the mir-31 target gene rasa1.
26747707_2	in addition, our data demonstrate mir-31 enhances invasion-migration of pancreatic cancer cells through its target gene rasa1 and subsequent activation of rho.
26747707_3	ollectively, our results confirm that mir-31 regulates rasa1 in pdac cells.
25822980_2	the increased expression level in all the three mir160 target genes suggests that mir160 is affected in the atttp-oe line.
26265120_1	we screened the targets of mir-155 using targetscan and mirecords, and rab6a was predicted as a putative mir-155 target gene.

26265120_4	we identified sirt1 as a novel target of mir-155.
26265120_5	these findings suggested that mir-155 suppresses rab6a through degradation of mrna.the

26646011_1	last, we validated in human hepatoma cells that both mir-21 and mir-27 significantly repress cholesterol synthesis and that mir-27 does so inpart through regulation of the gene that codes for the rate-limiting enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzymea reductase .
26646011_2	fourth, we validated through cell-based assays that mir-27, which is prominently dysregulated in both chb and chc as well as in hcc, significantly represses cholesterol synthesis inpart through regulation of the gene that codes for the rate-limiting enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme a reductase .
26646011_3	furthermore, we demonstrated that the effect of mir-27 is mediated in part through direct regulation of the hmgcr gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis.
26471185_1	taken together, these data support the bioinformatics predictions indicating fos and met 3'-utrs as direct targets of mir-449a.

20676106_2	rnahybrid modeling of the rasa1 3'utr predicted two mir-132 binding sites, separated by 40 bases .
20676106_3	accordingly, ectopic expression of mir-132 suppressed a luciferase reporter upstream of a 70-bp region of the rasa1 3'utr .
20676106_4	furthermore, knockdown of mir-132 with an anti-搈ir-132 markedly increased p120rasgap levels in vitro in huvecs and in vivo during bfgf-induced angiogenesis in subcutaneous matrigel implants in mice .

22660635_3	subsequent injection of mice with lentiviruses encoding tab2 or tab3 containing mutated mir-23b target sites markedly reduced the mir-23b-mediated suppression of cia , suggesting that tab2 and tab3 are key targets of mir-23b in vivo and contribute to the beneficial effects of mir-23b in mouse models of autoimmune disease.
26709120_1	wnt10b was previously proved to be the direct target of mir-148a and our result of luciferase reporter assay also confirmed it.

22528944_5	meanwhile, we found that hoxd10 is also regulated by mir-10b in hcc cells, with a corresponding change in the level of rhoc .
22528944_6	these results indicated that the prometastatic effect of mir-10b is partly mediated through regulation of cadm1 expression.
25647305_1	p21 was reported to be one of the target genes of mir-17 and mir-20a .
25647305_2	we found nc could markedly upregulate p21 , whereas overexpression of mir-17 and mir-20a antognized the protein level increment of p21 in k562 cells after treatment with nc .

22574173_2	we demonstrate that the transcription factors nrf1 and sox11 as well as the micrornas mir-182 and mir-96 are major factors involved in the regulation of spast.
22574173_3	we conclude that the related mir-96 and mir-182 family of mirnas provide strong regulation of spastin synthesis in human neural cells and affect both mrna and protein levels, and that this mechanism likely extends across all tetrapod organisms.
22574173_4	in this work, we have shown that mir-96 and mir-182 negatively regulate mrna and protein levels of spastin, with the target sites in the spast 3'utr conserved in all sequenced tetrapod species.

20656888_1	the role of fas as a targetgene was substantiated by abrogation of mir-146a, which markedly increased fas protein expression.
20656888_2	importantly, overexpression by precursor mir-146a expression plasmid reduced luciferase activity when cotransfected with the plasmid containing the 3'utr of the fas gene , indicating that forced expression of mir-146a downregulates fas expression via targeting its 3'utr .
20656888_3	taken together, these results demonstrated that fas is the major target of dz-induced mir-146a expression for inhibition of apoptosis.
22877943_1	a luciferasereporter assay suggested that mir-133a interacted with hla-g 3'utr.

22877943_3	the results from the luciferase reporter assay strongly suggested binding of the hla-g 3'utr by mir-133a.
22877943_4	however, mir-133a significantly decreased hla-g protein expression in jeg-3 cells compared with controls , indicating that hla-g expression is down-regulated by mir-133a at the protein level, not by targeting of hla-g mrna for degradation.
23583196_1	we demonstrate that the brain-enriched microrna, mirna-125 is a bona fide negative regulator of smg1 in humans.
23583196_2	down-regulation of smg1 expression is mediated by mirna-125 binding to a microrna response element in the 3' untranslated region of smg1 mrna, which leads to degradation of the smg1 mrna.
23583196_4	these data indicate that the predicted binding sites in the seed sequence are critical for the direct and specific binding of mir-125 to the smg1 mrna.
23583196_5	our results suggest that mir-125a and mir-125b decreased smg1 levels by degradation of the targetsmg1 mrna.

25653162_2	as seen in figure 3g deletion of all four snorna led to complete loss of gm residues from the 18s rrna, which further augments the importance of snr40 in gm562 methylation.
25653162_3	this clearly showed that snr40 is involved in methylation of gm at potion 562 in the helix 18 of 5' central domain of 18s rrna.
24876306_1	using qpcr and dual luciferase technology we show that mir-155 delivery resulted in a significant increase in cellular mir-155 which facilitated a downregulation of socs1 gene expression and a functional increase in il-6 and ifn-beta cytokines.

26807196_2	overexpression of mir-873 promoted the proliferation and migration of lung adenocarcinoma cells, while srcin1 upregulation inhibited their proliferation and migration.
26807196_3	restoration of srcin1 could significantly reverse the proliferation and migration promotion imposed by mir-873. in summary, this study reveals for the first time that mir-873 increase the lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and migration through directly inhibiting srcin1 expression.

25867271_3	we found that mir-21 and mir-106a mimics also inhibited luciferase activity and suppressed the expression of smad7 at mrna and protein levels in panc1 cells . in addition, the levels of mir-21 and mir-106a negatively correlated with smad7 mrna level in pdac patients .
25867271_4	these results were obtained from both hek293 cells and the pancreatic cancer cell line panc-1 , suggesting that mir-367 suppresses smad7 expression through directly targeting the mirna-binding site in the smad7 3'utr. in addition, mir-367 expression in the cancer tissues with negative smad7 expression was significantly higher than those with positive smad7 expression, suggesting a negative correlation between mir-367 and smad7 expressions .

22357618_2	cotransfection of pegp-mir-212 with wild-type ptch1 3'utr and control renilla luciferase reporter construct prl-tk revealed a 90% fold decrease of firefly luciferase activity compared with that of the mutant ptch1 3'utr, indicating that mir-212 can modulate ptch1 gene expression via the mir-212 binding sites in its 3'utr .
22357618_3	the result indicated mir-212 could decrease ptch1 expression by mrna cleavage.
22357618_4	the results seen with transient transfection and bulk selected cells indicated ptch1 may be the effector that mediates the functional role of mir-212 on cell proliferation.

26283635_3	however, mutation of the potential element for mir-23a or mir-23b could not rescue the inhibitory role of mir-23a or mir-23b in cx43 expression , indicating that mir-23a b did not suppress cx43 expression in a direct manner via the predicted binding sites.
26283635_4	among the investigated mirs, we identified mir-200a as a novel and direct suppressor of cx43 gene.

22156201_2	together with the lack of alteration in expression of phosphorylated ikks and ikk activity upon mir-30e overexpression of downregulation ,these results indicate that mir-30e may directly modulate ikappabalpha expression at the translational level.
22156201_3	point mutations in the tentative mir-30e binding seed region in the ikappabalpha 3'utr abrogated the aforementioned repressive effect of mir-30e*, demonstrating that ikappabalpha is a bona fide target of mir-30e .

22811578_1	c-fos was found to be a target of mir-101a because overexpression of mir-101a decreased the protein and mrna levels of c-fos and its downstream protein transforming growth factor--beta1.
22811578_3	our computational analysis predicted that mir-101 has the potential to repress c-fos: the 3- -untranslated region of fos mrna contains 1 binding site for mir-101 among humans, rats, and mice.
22811578_4	previous study has experimentally identified human fos mrna as a target of mir-101 by luciferase assay. in this study, we first confirmed the regulation of rat and mousefos by mir-101a by luciferase assay.
22811578_5	these data suggest that c-fos and its downstream protein tgf-beta1 play an important role in mir-101a-搈ediated suppression of cf proliferation.
22139444_1	these results suggest that mir-30c acts as a tumor suppressor and negatively regulates endometrial cancer cells by targeting mta1.
22139444_2	our study showed that overexpression of mir-30c leads to the down-regulation of mta1 both at the mrna and protein levels.
22139444_3	together, mir-30c suppresses cell proliferation and invasion partly by reversely regulating mta1 expression.
22139444_4	figure 2. mir-30c target 3'utr of mta1.
24880483_1	overexpression of mir-1246 promoted uvb-induced apoptosis, while knockdown of mir-1246, using a specific inhibitor, resulted in a significant reduction in uvb-elicited apoptosis.
24880483_2	we further demonstrate that mir-1246 negatively regulated the expression of rtkn2 through binding to the 3'-untranslated region of rtkn2 at the posttranscriptional level.
24880483_3	moreover, rtkn2 was observed to be resistant to uvb-induced apoptosis and rtkn2 antagonized the pro-apoptotic effects of mir-1246 during uvb-induced apoptosis in hacat cells.

23507142_2	furthermore, we confirmed that igf1r is a direct target of mir-16.
23904268_1	mir-29b represses cdk2 translation through direct interaction with the cdk2 mrna via its 3'-untranslated region , whereas point mutation of mir-29b binding site in the cdk2 3'utr prevents mir-29b-搃nduced repression of cdk2 translation.
23904268_2	moreover, mir-29b directly interacts with the cdk2 mrna via its 3'utr and to repress cdk2 translation.
23904268_3	taken together, these results indicate that mir-29b interacts with the cdk2 mrna via its 3'utr, thus repressing cdk2 translation.
26845446_1	these results indicate that mir-133a binds directly to the 3'utr of igf-1r, consequently inhibiting igf-1r expression
21266077_1	mir-34a overexpression results in the downregulation of map3k9.
21266077_2	as illustrated in additional file 3, figure s3, co-transfection of psi mir-34a with mature mir-34a mimics did not decrease luciferase activity relative to the negative control.
21266077_3	negative results for these experiments were obtained at different time points and with two cell lines , indicating that either the mir-34a affect on map3k9 is not a direct effect, or that there is some conformational structural difference between the 3'utr of the reporter versus the native 3'utr, which inhibits mir-34a targeting of the reporter.
18973228_3	this property has been addressed for mir-9 and mir-125a, whose rescued expression promoted medulloblastoma cell growth arrest and apoptosis while targeting the proproliferative truncated trkc isoform. in conclusion, misregulated microrna expression profiles characterize human medulloblastomas, and may provide potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies.
26746193_1	to confirm the active target site of mir-150, the 39 utr of slc2a1 was cloned into a luciferase reporter vector, which was then subjected to targeted mutagenesis to alter the seed site and disrupt mir-150 binding .

23353818_2	in addition, the detection of mir-296-5p and expression of cdx1 in primary gc tissues and adjacent im tissues revealed that mir-296-5p is inversely correlated with cdx1, further supporting our in vitro results.
19258450_1	the reduction of mir-34a expression in organotypic tissues derived from hpv-containing primary human keratinocytes correlates with the early productive phase and is attributed to the expression of viral e6, which destabilizes the tumor suppressor p53, a known mir-34a transactivator.

23184950_1	the pattern ofegr1 expression was the opposite of the mmu-mir-7578 expression pattern following lps induction , suggesting that up-regulation of mmu-mir-7578 may repressegr1 expression.
23184950_2	these data indicate that mmu-mir-7578 regulates egr1 expression both on mrna and protein levels.
23184950_3	taken together, the above data suggest that mmu-mir-7578 directly targets egr1 and represses its expression mainly by binding to mrea and mreb within its 3'utr, but mrec does not make a significant contribution to mmu-mir-7578 recognition.
23184950_4	these observations demonstrate that egr1 down-regulation by mmu-mir-7578, as in egr1 ablation, inhibits the expression of tnfalpha and il6.

20842113_2	as shown in figure 5b, the luciferase activity was significantly inhibited by mir-22 co-transfection, and further mir-22 failed to inhibit the expression of luciferase construct on target site deletion, suggesting that mir-22 can directly target the 3'utr of hdac4.
20842113_3	moreover, in hcc hep3b and smmc7721 cells, endogenous expression of hdac4 protein was suppressed by mir-22 transfection , further proving that hdac4 is directly targeted and regulated by mir-22 expression.
20842113_4	this result further confirms that endogenous hdac4 is regulated by mir-22 and mir-22 downregulation may participate in hcc carcinogenesis and progression through potentiation of hdac4 expression.
20842113_5	this result further suggests that mir-22 may suppress hcc cell proliferation at least partially through targeting hdac4 expression.
25961460_1	mir-26a markedly repressed the luciferase activity of the acsl3, acsl4, gsk3b, pkcd, pkcq, pck1, and tcf7l2 constructs .
25961460_2	mutation of the mir-26a target sites abrogated mir-26a associated repression in luciferase activity, suggesting a direct interaction of mir-26a with these sites.
25961460_3	these data demonstrate that mir-26a directly targets several key genes crucial for insulin signaling and metabolism of lipid and glucose, including acsl3, acsl4, gsk3b, pkcd, pkcq, pck1, and tcf7l2.
23142217_1	our data show that the mir-15b mimic targets the predicted binding site within the nrp-2 mrna 3'utr, as it decreased the luciferase in 9l cells transfected with a luciferase reporter vector containing the predicted binding site.
23142217_2	western blot analysis revealed that nrp-2 expression was significantly decreased by mir-15b mimic transfection, and mmp-3 expression was significantly decreased by mir-152 mimic transfection.
23142217_3	co-transfection of mir-15b and mir-152 mimic significantly decreased both mmp-3 and nrp-2 expression.
23142217_4	hese data show that mir-15b and mir-152 directly bind to their respective predicted binding sites in the nrp-2 and mmp-3.
22190470_1	a guanine-to-cytosine mutation at the 3'utr of cd274 mrna led to cd274 overexpression by disrupting the mir-570 binding.
22190470_2	this indicated potential mir-570-mediated regulation of cd274 expression.
22190470_3	these findings indicate that mir-570-mediated repression is specific to the cd274 gene.
22190470_4	these findings suggest that the mutation in cd274 3'utr is directly involved in posttranscriptional regulation mediated by mir-570.
22190470_5	furthermore, endogenous mir-570 was detected by rt-pcr analysis in both gastric cancer and normal tissues suggesting that mir-570 may be involved in cd274 translational inhibition . in summary, our work demonstrated that cd274 overexpression was contributed via a frequent somatic mutation in cd274 3'utr by disrupting posttranscriptional and translational controls mediated by mir-570.
26872014_1	therefore, real-time pcr and western blots analysis were performed to test whether mir-361-5p could regulate cxcr6.
26872014_2	as expected, mrna and protein levels of cxcr6 were reduced in hepg2 cells with mir-361-5p overexpression.
26872014_4	however, mutation of the mir-361-5p target site abrogated mir-361-5p-mediated reduction in luciferase activity .
25943633_1	cdc-27 is a direct target of mir-27a and its downregulation conferred increased radioresistance of the cells.
25943633_2	these results suggest that mir-27a can directly target cdc27 and regulate its expression in tnbc cells.
25943633_3	these results suggest that mir-27a can modulate radiosensitivity of tnbc cells through targeting cdc27. in this study, we verified a highly conserved putative binding site between mir-27a and cdc27 and demonstrated that mir-27a can directly regulate cdc27 expression in tnbc cancer cells.
26589417_1	luciferase assay showed that metadherin mrna was a direct target of mir-30a-5p.
26589417_3	we found that mir30a-5p could target mtdh 3'utr, and ectopic mir-30a-5p expression with special mimics could degrade its protein and mrna.

21709669_1	the proposed interaction between mir-148a and the 3' untranslated region of cdc25b was verified by in-vitro luciferase assays.
21709669_2	these data confirm the direct interaction between mir-148a and the 3'utr of cdc25b mrna.
21709669_3	concordant with our earlier results, we observed that the over-expression of mir-148a suppressed the endogenous cdc25b protein level in imim-pc2 cells below the detection limit .
21709669_4	further, our results for the first time demonstrate that cdc25b is a direct target of mir-148a.
26203557_1	these results confirmed that both subunits prkar1a and prkacb are direct targets of mir-200c.
20619502_1	taken together, these findings demonstrate that app is a target of mir-16 and the abnormally low expression of mir-16 could potentially lead to app protein accumulation in ad mice.
20619502_2	so, among these hypothesized mirnas, at least mir-16 may directly regulate app levels.
20619502_3	thus, mir-16 negatively target app in the 3'utr and inhibits app mrna translation, which in turn affects app protein translation rather than degradation of app mrna.
22370637_1	we demonstrate that bmf is a target of mir-34c-5p, and that its silencing, together with that of c-myc, a known target of mir-34c-5p, contributes to resistance to apoptosis induced by paclitaxel through p53 downregulation.
20451497_1	using luciferase reporter assays with 3'-utrs of tbp, over-expression and inhibition of mir-146a, we showed that mir-146a target tbp.
20451497_2	this result confirms that mir-146a target tbp.
20451497_3	since mir-146a is down regulated in sthdh hdh cells, it is expected that endogenous expression of tbp would be higher in these cells.
20451497_4	expression of endogenous tbp in mrna as well as protein level was decreased in sthdhq111  hdhq111 cells expressing exogenous mir-146a .

20368621_1	we further show that mir-137 post-transcriptionally represses the expression of ezh2, a histone methyltransferase and polycomb group protein.
20368621_2	furthermore, targeting of ezh2 by mir-137 was specific because mutating the seed sequence targeted by mir-137 within the luciferase-ezh2-3'utr reporter alleviated mir-137-mediated suppression .
20368621_3	together, these data demonstrate that the effect of mir-137 on ezh2 protein expression is repressive, post-transcriptional, and specific.
20368621_4	importantly, they also suggest that ezh2 is a functional target of mir-137 in the context of adult neurogenesis.

23894385_3	thus, we performed mutation assays of the putative binding sites to confirm that the sdf-1alpha 3'utr is a direct target of mir-27a and mir-27b .
16966691_1	the overexpression of mir-21 is strongly associated with both a high ki67 proliferation index and presence of liver metastasis.

19514064_2	recently, we found that a genetic variant of rs11614913 in the mir-196a2 sequence could alter mature mir-196a expression and target mrna binding; this observation led us to hypothesize that rs11614913 might influence susceptibility to sporadic congenital heart disease .
19514064_3	we conducted a three-stage case-control study of chd in chinese to test our hypothesis by genotyping mir-196a2 rs11614913 and three other pre-mirna snps in 1,324 chd cases and 1,783 non-chd controls.
19514064_4	we found that rs11614913 cc was associated with a significantly increased risk of chd in all three stages combined . in a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis using 29 cardiac tissue samples of chd, rs11614913 cc was associated with significantly increased mature mir-196a expression . in vitro binding assays further revealed that the rs11614913 variant affects hoxb8 binding to mature mir-196a.

20351277_3	these results are qualitatively similar to the luciferase-based system containing the mir-155 seed sequence from hmlh1 and hmsh6 , and suggest that mir-risc ribosome displacement is unlikely to be an issue in mir-155 modulation of mmr proteins.

20966078_1	in the present study, we demonstrated by a luciferase reporter assay that mir-491-5p down-regulated the luciferase activity through a binding site in the 3'utr of par-3.
20966078_2	although the luciferase reporter assay was useful in evaluating the effect of mir-491-5p on regulating par-3 expression, it is important to demonstrate that mir-491-5p can regulate the expression of endogenous par-3. to ensure the effect of mir-491-5p on par-3 expression was not specific to nrk52e cells, we transfected gfp-tagged mir-491-5p in human proximal tubular epithelial cells and demonstrated that mir-491-5p, too, significantly down-regulated par-3 expression .

26101709_1	dual-luciferase assays confirmed that mir-520d-5p directly targeting cthrc1 and sp1 transactivate mir-520d-5p by binding to its upstream promoter region.
26101709_2	mechanically, mir-520d-5p directly targeted cthrc1 and could be regulated by specificity protein 1 .
26101709_3	in summary, our findings revealed that mir-520d-5p reversely regulated cthrc1 by directly targeting its mrna 3'utr.
26101709_4	taken together, the above studies indicate that mir-520d-5p may play a role in the emt of crc by inactivating the phosphorylation of erk1 2 via directly targeting cthrc1.

21757686_1	consistent with these findings, ezh2 was down-regulated by let-7b and less so by the other mirnas .
21757686_2	significantly, the use of a let-7b antagonist reversed the effect of kdm2b depletion on ezh2 suggesting that a kdm2b-let-7b axis regulates ezh2 levels in mefs.
21757686_3	e2f2 levels decline during senescence , and in line with previous studies of let-7 98 targets , we found that e2f2 expression was also suppressed by let-7b .
21757686_4	importantly, overexpression of kdm2b potently increased the expression of e2f2 , as well as that of c-myc, an additional let-7b target .
21757686_5	therefore, kdm2b function in growth control and ezh2 regulation extends beyond the bypass of senescence in primary cells through a mechanism associated with regulation of let-7b mirna.

19887623_3	moreover, inhibition of mir-129-3p or mir-129-5p by antagomirs slightly enhanced the expression of sox4, suggesting that this gene is a direct target of mir-129-2.
19887623_4	taken together, the observation indirectly indicates that these epigenetic treatments may lead to reactivation of mir-129-2, which in turn represses the expression of sox4.
19887623_5	taken together, these in vitro studies suggest that mir-129-2 negatively regulates sox4 and that promoter hypermethylation of this mirna derepresses its expression.
19887623_6	transient transfection of these cells with either mir-129-3p or mir-129-5p resulted in reduction of both sox4 mrna and protein .

26320176_2	to our knowledge, however, it is not reported whether mir-146b-5p suppresses glioma cell proliferation and induces apoptosis through directly targeting traf6.
26320176_3	we further demonstrate that traf6 is a direct functional target of mir-146b-5p in gliomas and silencing of traf6 may mimic the above anti-tumor effects of mir-146b-5p.
23720784_1	moreover, the effects of mir-218-2 on thyroid cancer cells were due, at least partially, to targeting pdgfra and plcg1.

22533346_6	we also observed an inverse correlation between mir-143 and macc1 expression in crc tissues and their adjacent normal tissues .
21029862_2	however, our data demonstrate that jpx upregulation is developmentally regulated to correlate with xist upregulation, and that jpx significantly escapes xci.our data argue that jpx is an activator of xist.therefore,

23728339_2	examine whether mir-30 attenuates erg expression through direct targeting of the predicted 3'utr region, a 42-base pair fragment of the erg 3'utr containing the wild-type or mutant mir-30 binding site were constructed downstream of the luciferase gene in a reporter plasmid .
23728339_3	293t cells were transfected with the utr-reporter plus the negative control mirna , mir-30a or mir-30b.only
23728339_4	transfection of mir-30a and mir-30b with the wild-type utr-reporter led to a significant decrease of luciferase activity whereas coexpression of the antagomirs of mir-30 has no effect on the reporter activities .

26919240_2	mir-342 targets the anti-apoptotic gene birc6 in hcc1937 cells.
26919240_3	this result confirmed that the pro-apoptotic function of mir-342 is strictly dependent on the presence of mutated brca1 and suggested that additional mirna targets may be involved in the establishment of the synthetic lethal phenotype.
26919246_2	in addition, the results of the qpcr and western blot analysis demonstrated that transfection with mir-200b mimics significantly reduced the mrna and protein expression levels of bmi1 in hcc cells.
26919246_3	taken together, these results indicate that bmi1 is a direct target gene of mir-200b and can be negatively regulated by mir-200b.
26095675_1	when mir-141 was overexpressed in cmec and cmt28, by transfecting with a higher concentration, it caused further reduction in luciferase expression thereby silencing 3'utr target and validating mir-141 cdkn2a target binding .
26095675_2	additionally, this experimental evidence suggests that lack of mir-141 mediated silencing in the cmt28 cell line was permissive for p14arf mrna expression leading to the discovery of the longer 3'utr sequence containing the mir-141 target site in these cells.
20630862_2	the let-7 family target recognition sequence in the il-13 3'utr is highly conserved across mammalian species .

20198305_3	infection of hsa-mir-34c mediated by lentivirus suppressed the expression of c-met directly.
20198305_4	in addition, introduction of c-met cdna lacking 3'utr largely abrogated hsa-mir-34c-induced cell growth and invasion inhibition.

21885853_3	mir-33 was used as a positive control for inhibition of abca1 expression .
21885853_4	mir-758 also repressed abca1 protein in mouse peritoneal macrophages and hepatic cell lines , indicating that its effect is not cell type specific.
21885853_5	notably, inhibition of endogenous mir-758 by anti-mir-758 increased the expression of abca1 in macrophages and hepatic cells , suggesting a physiological role of mir-758 in regulating the expression of this transporter.
21885853_7	mir-758 markedly repressed the activity of the abca1 3'utr reporter construct .
21885853_8	specific site-directed mutations in site 2, which is widely conserved among several species, abolishes the mir-758 repression of abca1 3'utr activity, suggesting that this site is the most important in the posttranscriptional repression of abca1 by mir-758 .

25333261_3	taken together, these results indicate that mtdh is a direct downstream target of mir-145 and mtdh overexpression in hgsoc may be attributed to the reduced expression of mir-145.
25333261_4	we showed that mtdh was directly targeted by mir-145.
21857907_1	next, we evaluated whether overexpression of mir-34a resulted in decreased sirt1 at the protein level.
21857907_2	sirt1 protein was significantly decreased after mir-34a overexpression , suggesting that the effect of mir-34a on the number of postmitotic neurons and neurite elongation might be mediated by sirt1.
21857907_3	these results suggested that the effect of mir-34a on the percentage of postmitotic neurons was not mediated by sirt1.
21857907_4	these results support the observation that mir-34a may modulate neurite outgrowth by targeting sirt1.
21857907_5	importantly, a similar increase in acetylated p53 was observed after mir-34a overexpression, suggesting that mir-34a may increase p53 acetylation and subsequent p53 transcriptional activity due to decreased sirt1 expression.

20935646_3	these experiments identified foxo1 as a target of mir-182 in activated helper t lymphocytes.
20935646_4	in these cells, foxo1 was targeted only by mir-182 but not by mir-96, which was not expressed.
20935646_5	we quantified foxo1 mrna and mir-182 in activated mouse and human helper t cells.
20935646_6	as expected, mir-182 and foxo1 mrna showed a negative correlation in mouse helper t cells and human helper t cells , with increasing mir-182 and decreasing foxo1 mrna over time.
20935646_7	to further confirm the interaction of mir-182 and foxo1, we inhibited mir-182 by using locked nucleic acid oligomers10 or antagomir oligonucleotides; each bound and inhibited the mature mirna.

22871591_3	these results indicate that mir-204 plays a negative role in vsmc calcification through down-regulating runx2 protein levels.
22871591_4	in conclusion, this study identified mir-204 as an important regulator of vsmc functions by repressing its targetgene runx2 and inhibiting medial artery calcification in vivo, which represents a novel mechanism regulating vascular calcification.
26585487_1	then luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify whether the 3'utr of foxc1 mrna was a binding target of mir-4792.

21715310_2	mir-221 repressed a construct containing the ets2 3'utr downstream of the luciferase gene .
21715310_4	in addition, 2 putative mir-222-binding sites were mapped in the 3'utr of ets1 .
21715310_5	reporter assays again showed that mir-222 could directly interact with both binding motifs and reduce the activity of a luciferase reporter gene fused to the ets1 3'utr .
21715310_6	mutating either of the predicted mir-222-binding sites restored mir-222-mediated repression .
23318130_1	mirna-124a mimic induced a decrease in luciferase activity, which could be reversed by simultaneous administration of the respective anti-mirna, indicating that mecp2 is a direct target of mirna-124a as predicted . in spinal cord slices, we could show that mecp2 protein is localized in the same cells in which mirna-124a is expressed , thus indicating their possible interaction.

21989846_5	higher sox6 levels were observed when mir-155 expression levels were reduced, irrespective of the tumor status of the tissue.
21989846_6	in conclusion, the current study has revealed a novel mechanism involving the regulation of sox6 and p21 by mir-155, and we postulate that this mechanism is a key step in the multistep process leading to the development of hcc.

21671467_3	furthermore, mir-338-3p did not have any observable effects on the mutated smo 3'utr luciferase reporter , indicating that mir-338-3p indeed was able to silence smo gene expression.
21671467_4	these results suggest that the effects of mir-338-3p are through suppression of smo expression. in conclusion, our study demonstrated that mir-338-3p can inhibit liver cancer cell invasion through inhibiting smo-mediated mmp9 expression in vitro.
26886608_1	therefore, mir-17-92 negatively regulates the expression of bim, stat3, c-kit, and socs3 in mouse testes.

19666866_4	mir-135a-mediated jak2 downregulation led to decreased mrna and protein levels of the antiapoptotic gene bcl-xl, suggesting a role for bcl-xl in mir-135a jak2-mediated apoptosis.
19666866_5	our findings confirm the critical role of mir-135a in the survival of chl cells and in the prognosis of chl patients, indicating that novel treatment approaches targeting mir-135a may potentially benefit these patients.
18803879_1	for mir-34 restoration, we transfected the kato iii cells with mir-34 mimics.
18803879_2	as shown in figure 3, western blot analysis revealed that transfection of mir-34 mimics downregulated targetgene bcl-2 expression at the protein level, but had no obvious effect on bcl-xl and mcl-1 expression, indicating that the bcl-2 knockdown by mir-34 mimics was sequence-specific.
18803879_3	as a target of mir-34, bax was also downregulated by mir-34.
23637592_1	we identified a novel mir-155 target, det1, an evolutionarily-conserved factor involved in c-jun ubiquitination.
23637592_2	these results suggest that det1 protein translation is directly targeted by mir-155 binding to the 3'utr sequence.
23637592_3	together, these experiments show that mir-155 can target det1 leading to c-jun accumulation in transformed theileria-infected leukocytes.
23637592_4	we provide evidence that mir-155 targets the det1 protein, which leads to accumulation of the c-jun protein and increased transcription of the mir-155-encoding bic gene .

23484856_1	we find that mir-125a-5p targets evolutionarily conserved sequences in the lfng 3'utr and that preventing interactions between mir-125a-5p and lfng transcripts in vivo causes abnormal segmentation and perturbs clock activity.
23484856_2	mutation of predicted mir-125a-5p binding sites at either end of the mouse 3'utr, or of the single site in the chicken 3'utr abrogates the effect of exogenous mir-125a-5p, indicating that mir-125a-5p directly interacts with the lfng 3'utr and that these interactions are conserved among organisms that utilize lfng in the segmentation clock.
23484856_3	overall, our findings are consistent with a model wherein blocking interactions between mir-125a-5p and lfng in chick embryos initially results in stabilization of lfng mrna, although we cannot rule out that this interaction may also affect translational efficiency of the transcripts .
20735984_2	these results indicated that mir-155 interfered with luciferase mrna translation via direct interaction with rat at1r 3'utr.

26075749_4	mir-708-5p showed a significant suppressive effect on the firefly luciferase activity compared with mir-nc and mock control .
26075749_5	because nnat expression is responsible for the uptake of calcium by the er, we tested if mir-708-5p- and metformin-induced knockdown of nnat changed the level of calcium in the cytoplasm and the reuptake to er. these results imply that metformin and mir-708-5p induce apoptosis and er stress in prostate cancer cells by targeting nnat.

26147452_1	we show that microrna-194 expression is uniquely suppressed in ebv+ b cell lines from ptld patients and that the 3'untranslated region of il-10 is targeted by microrna-194.
26147452_2	overexpression of microrna-194 attenuates il-10 production and increases apoptosis of ebv+ b cell lymphoma lines. in contrast, a vector expressing mir-340, which is modulated by ebv but is not predicted to target the 3'utr of il-10, had no effect on renilla luciferase expression .
26875774_1	furthermore, we demonstrated that the expression of the foxp3 gene was modulated by mir-125a-5p in jurkat cells.
26875774_2	therefore, we concluded that the inserted fragment of the foxp3 3'utr was the target of mir-125a-5p.
26875774_3	thus, it is likely that mir-125a-5p decreases foxp3 expression by targeting its mrna for degradation.

22287707_4	thus, during inkt cell development in thymus, the dynamic expression pattern of c-myb is in mirror contrast with that of mir-150 , which may be required for inkt cell maturation.
22287707_5	furthermore, c-myb expression was significantly upregulated in both immature and mature inkt cells from mir-150ko mice compared with that in wt mice .

26858253_2	most importantly, overexpression of mir-17 was able to blunt ifn纬-induced txnip expression , suggesting that ifngamma up-regulated txnip expression via inhibition of mir-17.
26858253_3	combined, these findings suggest that ifngamma induces txnip expression via induction of er stress, activation of ire1alpha and degradation of mir-17.
22805767_1	by real-time pcr, western blot analysis and mirna mimic and 3'utr-luctransfection, we found that trim68 is a direct target of mir-29a and mir-1256 and that the downregulation of mir-29a and mir-1256 in pca cells leads to increased expression of trim68 and pgk-1 in pca cells and in human tumor tissue specimens.

19859555_2	in contrast, when src was activated in myotubes, p27 protein levels were reduced up to 5 fold while p27 mrna levels were barely affected , suggesting that down-regulation of p27 protein involves translational inhibition mechanisms, possibly dependent on the corresponding increased accumulation of mir-221 222.
19859555_3	in both cell types, inhibition of mir-221 222 resulted in a partial recovery of p27 accumulation , suggesting that p27 mrna is regulated by these mirnas in myogenic cells.

21741600_4	that similar glycosylation changes are induced by both mir-30d upregulation and sigalnt7, and are restored by re-expressing galnt7, supports the key contribution of galnt7 repression to mir-30d-associated phenotypes.
21741600_5	these results suggest that mir-30d 30b induce il-10 at least in part by repressing galnt7, revealing an unexpected role for a single galnac transferase in linking tumor cell invasion and immune modulation.
22570635_1	furthermore, we identified drep-2 and vimar as functional targets of mir-277 that could modulate rcgg repeat-mediated neurodegeneration.
22570635_2	importantly, they also suggest that drep-2 and vimar are the functional targets of mir-277.

22865422_3	we speculated that mir-134 could regulate mor1 expression after allodynia in drgs and those small-diameter neurons might provide important sites for this modulation.
22865422_4	since silencing mir-134 increased mor1 expression, these data suggested that mor1 could be a target of mir-134.
26781774_1	using targetscan and pictar online software,we found that cyclin d1, the tumour repressor gene pten, and p21 were candidate targets of the mir-17~92 cluster.

26781774_3	we found that the loss of mir-17~92 noticeably reduced akt phosphorylation in the female mice, particularly at 24 and 36 hrs post-operation , suggesting that the inhibitory effects of pten and p21 on liver regeneration overwhelmed the inductive effect of cyclin d1 in association with mir-17~92 deficiency.

20146264_2	transfection with precursors of mir-148a and mir-152 significantly modulated reporter activity in mz-cha-1 cells, whereas mir-301 precursor failed to show any effects.
20146264_3	next, the studies were repeated with random mutations in the shared recognition sequence, which resulted in abolition of the reporter activation by mir-148a and mir-152 precursors.
20146264_4	thereafter, we assessed whether ectopic expression of individual mir-148a, mir-152, and mir-301 sequences induces down-regulation of endogenous dnmt-1 protein expression.
20146264_5	taken together, these data confirm that dnmt-1 is a biologically relevant target of mir-148a and mir-152.
20146264_6	enforced expression of mir-148a and mir-152 in mz-cha-1 and kmch cells was also noted to significantly enhance rassf1a and p16ink4a expressions concomitant with decreased dnmt-1 protein level .
26606254_1	from the set of mirna-mrna interactions that were found during the development of thymocytes into pils, we identified interactions between mir- 202-3p and the ccr7 chemokine receptor and cd247 mrnas, which were previously found to be involved in the control of aggressive autoimmunity in t1d in nod mice.
26606254_2	we confirmed that mir-202-3p interacts with ccr7 or cd247 by its hybridization to their respective 3'utr sequences, which contain the predicted binding sites for this mirna.
26606254_3	in a more focused examination of pils, we observed that mir-202-3p regulates the ccr7 and cd247 mrnas.

23728176_2	taken together, it is shown that mir-17-5p and mir-432 are direct endogenous regulators of adar1, which cofunction in an additive manner.
23728176_3	finally, we identified mir-17-5p and mir-432 as the direct, independent, endogenous cellular regulators of adar1.

21170987_2	taken together with the finding that suppression of plk1 greatly reduces cell proliferation, growth suppression of ec cells by mir-593 is at least in part due to plk1 downregulation by this mir.
21170987_3	moreover, mir-593 expression levels were inversely correlated with plk1 mrna expression levels in 48 surgically resected esophageal cancer tissues .
21170987_5	thus, the exogenous mir-593 mimic reduced plk1 mrna and protein levels more markedly in hsa c cells than in oe33 cells.
21170987_6	conversely, the exogenous mir-593 inhibitor elevated plk1 expression more clearly in oe33 cells than in hsa c cells.
21170987_7	this result indicated that mir-593 did not affect the promoter activity of the reporter construct and suggested that plk1 mrna was degraded by mir-593*.
21170987_8	this result suggested that mir-593 interacted with both bindsg sites to regulate plk1 expression, but that the bindsg of mir-593 to the site 1 contributed more to post-transcriptional regulation of plk1 than the site 2.
20603620_1	our results reveal that mirna-185 translationally represses six1 by binding to its 3'-untranslated region.
20603620_2	in contrast, silencing of mir-185 using a specific mir-185 inhibitor in hek-293 and skov3 cells resulted in marked induction of six1 protein levels.
20603620_3	real-time pcr analysis showed that six1 mrna levels were also reduced in mir-185-overexpressing cells, indicating that mir-185 regulates six1 expression in human cancers both at the rna and protein levels.

19407815_3	ryhb represses the downstream part of the isc polycistron, iscsua, without affecting the upstream part, iscr.
19407815_4	this surprising observation suggests that ryhb induces a discoordination in the iscrsua polycistronic transcript, which results in specific iscr expression during iron depletion.this
19818772_1	here, we show that an additional isomer of mirna-125 translationally arrests mrna of the p53 tumor suppressor gene.
19818772_2	the basis of this activity is the high degree of sequence homology between the seed sequence of mir-125a and the 3'utr of p53.
19818772_5	2a, ectopic expression of mirna-125a had no effect on p53 mrna levels as quantified by real time pcr thus supporting translational inhibition as the primary mode of gene silencing.
19818772_6	mirna-125a proved almost as efficacious as specific sirna against p53 in reducing protein levels .
21078976_1	mir-21 appears to targetedirectly the 3'utr of both the hmsh2 and hmsh6 mrna, resulting in significant downregulation of protein expression.
21078976_2	these results suggest that mir-21 overexpression does not affect the mrna levels of hmsh2 or hmsh6.
21078976_3	taken as a whole, these results suggest that mir-21 exerts a direct effect on the hmsh2 and hmsh6 3'utr that ultimately regulates hmsh2 and hmsh6 protein expression.
21078976_4	an inverse correlation still was evident in the remaining eight cases, highlighting the inverse correlation between mir-21 overexpression and hmsh2 downregulation in crc tumors .
21078976_5	taken as a whole, these results are consistent with the conclusion that down-regulation of hmsh2 expression by mir- 21 results in cellular resistance to 5-fu.
21078976_6	taken together, our results support a central role for mir-21-dependent down-regulation of the hmsh2-hmsh6 heterodimer mmr protein in 5-fu resistance.

19701247_1	the 3'utr of upa mrna is a direct target of mir-193b.
19701247_2	mir-193b might be a negative regulator for upa.
19701247_3	during breast cancer cell metastasis, the expression of mir-193b is downregulated, which in turn contributes to enhanced upa expression and invasion.
19701247_4	these results supported the bioinformatic prediction that the 3'utr of upa mrna might be a direct target for mir-193b, and denoted that the matching site identified strongly contributed to the mirna-mrna interaction mediating the inhibition of upa expression.
19701247_5	these data are functionally relevant, and further reinforce our earlier hypothesis that downregulated mir-193b contributed to enhanced upa expression and invasiveness.
19701247_6	these findings suggest that upa is indeed a functionally important target of mir-193b, and that upa downregulation is necessary for mir-193b-mediated repression of proliferation, migration and invasion.
19701247_7	these in vivo data suggested that mir-193b is a negative regulator for upa at the post-transcriptional level.
19713529_1	thus, the two mir-128 targetsites predicted in the reelin and dcx 3'utrs are sufficient and necessary to induce the mir-128-mediated decrease of the corresponding protein products.
19713529_2	the reelin and dcx 3'utrs are direct target of mir-128.
19713529_3	these results led us to hypothesize that the observed inverse relationship between mir-128 and reelin and dcx protein expression could be due, at least in part, to a direct regulatory effect exerted by mir-128 on reelin and dcx mrnas.
19713529_4	the results of mir-128-overexpression and loss-of-function experiments are complementary and suggest that mir-128 specifically down-regulates reelin and dcx at the post-transcriptional level.
22287715_1	collectively, these data show that mir-127 target macrophage cd64 expression and promotes thereduction of lung inflammation.
22287715_2	these data display an inverse relationship between cd64 expression and mir-127 expression, indicating that cd64 is a putative target of mir-127.
22287715_3	together, these data demonstrate that cd64 is a potential target of mir-127 and is downregulated by mir-127 overexpression.
22287715_4	these suggest that mir-127 reduced the luciferase activity by binding to cd64- 3'utr, but had no effect on cd64 mutant 3'utr.
22287715_5	therefore, we concluded that cd64 is a bona fide target of mir-127.
22287715_6	specifically, we identify that mir-127 targeted cd64.
23141496_2	to further confirm that mir-1 binds the fabp3 3'utr, immunoprecipitation of biotinylated mir-1 oligo was performed on homogenate from adult mouseheart followed by rna extraction and pcr analysis for fabp3 mrna.
23141496_3	consistent with the preceding results, a specific pcr signal for fabp3 was obtained, which was absent in the negative control . in addition, western blot analysis of 293 cells transduced with admir1 revealed a decrease in fabp3 protein levels upon mir-1 overexpression .
23141496_4	all together, these results demonstrate that fabp3 mrna is a direct target of mir-1.
23141496_5	for the purpose of the current study, the obtained results confirmed an inverse relationship between mir-1 and fabp3 expression, and suggest the presence of an igf-1 mir-1 fabp3 signaling axis.

18006846_1	the oncogenic activity of mir-27a in mda-mb-231 cells is due, in part, to suppression of zbtb10 and myt-1, which regulate specificity protein transcription factors and the g2-m chechpoint in mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells.

16982751_5	the enzymatic activity of cyp1b1 was increased by the electroporation of the aso for mir-27b in mcf-7 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners . in contrast to the cyp1b1 protein level, no relationship was observed between the cyp1b1 mrna level and the mir-27b level in human breast tissues .
16982751_6	these results suggested that cyp1b1 is post-transcriptionally regulated by mir-27b.
16982751_7	the decreased expression of mir-27b would be one of the causes of the high expression of cyp1b1 protein in cancerous tissues.
19546220_1	interestingly, mir-27b and its putative targetgene, st14 , had inverse expression pattern in breast cancer cells.
19546220_2	expression levels of st14 showed an inverse relation with the expression pattern of mir-27b at both the rna and protein levels , suggesting that st14 may be negatively regulated by mir-27b.
19546220_3	these data suggest that mir-27b specifically binds the 3'utr region of st14 and reduces st14 expression.

21212803_1	these data indicate that mir-31 target the 3'utr of the dystrophin mrna and that repression is prevented either by the use of mir-31 decoys or by protecting the mir-31 binding site on dystrophin mrna. in all cases dystrophin mrna levels were not affected by mir-31 modulation, indicating that the mirna acts by repressing translation rather than controlling dystrophin mrna stability.

16940181_1	mir-17-5p represses estrogen er-independent breast cancer cell proliferation by targeting aib1.
16940181_2	the inhibitory effects of mir-17-5p on estrogen independent breast cancer cell growth appears to be due to translational regulation of two important players in this pathway: aib1 and e2f1.
16940181_3	a recent report suggests that e2f1 is a target of mir-17-5p at the translational level .
16940181_4	by careful examination of e2f1 coding and noncoding 3'utr, we found only one mir-17-5p recognition site.
16940181_6	therefore, there is a possibility that mir-17-5p may not directly regulate the expression of e2f1 but rather have an indirect effect on e2f1 activity.
16940181_7	this observation further established that mir-17-5p could directly inhibit the translation of e2f1, albeit less effectively than the reduction of aib1.
16940181_9	these results suggest that the negative influence of mir-17-5p on e2f1 was both directly and indirectly due to aib1 downregulation at least in breast cancer cells
26111641_1	adam17 was a direct target gene of mir-326.

19223510_1	ubc9 is specifically suppressed by mir-30e and mir-30c.
19223510_2	western blot analysis revealed that both mir-30e and mir-30c suppressed ubc9 expression at the protein level .
19223510_3	to determine whether mir-30e and mir-30c affect the ubc9 mrna level, we carried out real-time rt-pcr analysis for the same cells transfected with mir-30e and mir-30c, and found that these two micrornas had no effect on the ubc9 mrna level , suggesting that they regulate ubc9 expression mainly through translation repression.
19223510_4	ubc9 is a direct target for mir-30e.
19223510_5	after transfection of 293t cells with this reporter construct along with mir-30e or mir-30c, we found that both mir-30e and mir-30c suppressed the luciferase activity by about 50% compared with the vector control , suggesting that ubc9 is a direct target for these two micrornas.
21186368_1	we found that both the alpha- and -beta-isoforms of the calcineurin catalytic subunit are direct targets of mir-499 and that mir-499 inhibits cardiomyocyte apoptosis through its suppression of calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of dynamin-related protein-1 , thereby decreasing drp1 accumulation in mitochondria and drp1-mediated activation of the mitochondrial fission program.
22248718_1	we discovered autophagy proteins atg4c and becn1 as cellular targets of mir-376b.
17906079_1	in this study, we showed that mir-24 could decrease human alk4 expression at the mrna and the protein levels through binding to the 3- -untranslated region of halk4 mrna, and interfere with activin signaling.
17906079_3	furthermore, the inhibitory effect of mir-24 on reporter expression was dose-dependent, but increasing concentrations of mir-205 had no effect on luciferase activity , indicating that mir-24 specifically target the halk4 3'utr.
26259828_1	we then identified ptp1b, a ubiquitously expressed phosphatase, as the target of mir-744 that is responsible for enhancing type i ifn response.
26259828_2	finally, mir-744 expression was induced by type i ifn in rmcs.
26259828_4	therefore, we concluded that mir-744 positively regulates the type i ifn signaling pathway in human rmcs by targeting ptp1b.
26915294_1	specifically, we evaluated the expression of crucial prosurvival proteins bcl-2 and bcl-xl, as their 3'-utrs are wellcharacterized targets of the mir-15 and let-7 families, respectively .14,15
26915294_3	these data provide direct evidence that the decrease in bcl-2 or bcl-xl expression following hdaci is due to an upregulation of the mir-15 and let-7 families, respectively, that bind and promote their downregulation.
26915294_4	therefore, blocking the mir-15 and let-7 families from binding bcl-2 or bcl-xl in breast cancer cells prevented the downregulation of bcl-2 and bcl-xl and blunted the apoptotic response resulting from hdaci.
26915294_5	collectively, the data reveal a novel mir-15 and let-7 family-mediated mechanism of apoptosis that underlies hdaci-induced breast and lung carcinoma cell death.

26629033_1	using the publicly available databases targetscan and miranda, we found two conserved mir-96 binding sites in the 3'-utrs of mtss1 gene .
26629033_2	these results indicated that the 3'utr of mtss1 was a functional target of mir-96 in tca8113 cells.
26629033_3	together, our results suggest that mtss1 expression was partly regulated by mir-96, thereby inhibiting tscc progression.
22305007_1	we identify the jak stat ligand, upd, as a target of mir-279 and show that knockdown of upd rescues the behavioral phenotypeof mir-279 mutants.
22305007_2	to determine whether mir-279 directly binds upd 3'utr and inhibits its expression, we performed a luciferase reporter assay in drosophilas2 cells.
22305007_3	a chimeric mrna was made by fusing the firefly luciferase open reading frame to the full-length upd 3'utr that contains all potential mir-279 binding sites .
22305007_4	as shown in figure 3d, upd mrna was up-regulated in adult brains of mir-279 null mutants.
22305007_5	on the other hand, mir-279 over-expression by a tim-gal4 driver reduced mrna levels of upd, with a higher dose of mir-279 producing a stronger effect .
22305007_6	we conclude that upd is a direct target of mir-279 in vitro and in vivo.
22305007_7	these data provide strong in vivo evidence that mir-279 regulates circadian rhythms by modulating levels of upd.
20227367_1	cab39 is a functionally relevant mir-451 target thus, mir-451 directly regulates cab39 expression by binding its predicted 3'utr targetsequence.
20227367_2	the effects of mir-451 on lkb1 activity are likely to be mediated directly by cab39.
20227367_3	this suggests that cab39 is a functionally relevant mir-451 targetin glioma cells.
20227367_4	taken together, these data show that mir-451 directly target and downregulates cab39, resulting in reduced lkb1-dependent phosphorylation of ampk and increased mtor activation.
25612549_1	bcl-2, bcl-xl and bcl2l11 which have an impact on the regulation of apoptosis were selected as potential hsa-mir-32-5p targets in caco-2 cells.
25612549_2	the observed coordinated regulation of hsa-mir-32-5p and bcl2l11 gene expression might be an indication that fatty acid-mediated downregulation of hsa-mir-32-5p in caco-2 cells could be accompanied by a downregulation of gene expression of apoptosis-inducing regulatory proteins whereas gene expression of apoptosis-inhibiting regulators such as bcl-2 and bcl-xl might be not directly affected by reduced hsa-mir-32-5p gene expression.
26816250_1	runt-related transcription factor 2 , a key transcription factor involved in oa, has been identified as a novel potential target of mir-105. in contrast, mir-105 inhibition promoted runx2 production in human chondrocytes .

22318941_1	the expression of microrna -23a, a candidate mir targeting pgc-1alpha and g6pc, was up-regulated in the mouseliver tumors as well as in primary human hcc.
22318941_2	we confirmed pgc-1alpha and g6pc as direct target of mir-23a and their expressions negatively correlated with mir-23a expression in human hccs.
22318941_3	the relative luciferase activity was reduced by 40% and 25% in pgc-1alpha and g6pc wildtype 3'utr, respectively, but not in respective mutant 3'-utrs or psicheck2 vector alone , suggesting that mir-23a cognate sites are essential for negative regulation of luciferase expression driven by pgc-1alpha-3'utr and g6pc-3'utr.
22318941_4	these results indicate that mir-23a interferes with pgc-1alpha and g6pc expression at both the mrna and protein levels.

21898400_3	our data showed that the protein levels of both mtor and sirt1 were dramatically decreased by the transfected precursors of mir-520c and mir-373 ; whereas their mrna levels were not changed .
21898400_4	these results indicated that mir-520c and mir-373 decreased the protein level of mtor and activated the ras-raf-mek-erk pathway and nf-kappab factor via activating pi3k and ikk, and thus resulting in up-regulation of mmp9.
21898400_5	we hypothesized it was possible that up-regulation of mmp9 was via direct targeting of the 3'utr of mrnas of mtor and sirt1 by mir-520c and mir-373, and blocking the translation of these two mrnas.
21898400_6	all of these mean that we have characterized a molecular mechanism of cooperative up-regulation of the expression of the mmp9 gene simultaneously by different signaling pathways via mir-520c and mir-373 targeting the 3'-utrs of mrnas of sirt1 and mtor .
26883272_1	ant2-specific shrna also inactivated the pi3k akt signaling pathway in the h1975 and hcc827 gr cells, which was mediated by the suppression of mir-221 222 levels and by the subsequent restoration of pten.
26883272_2	an examination of the mirna profile after ant2 shrna transfection in a549 cells revealed that mir-221 and 222 were most markedly down-regulated , and a database search indicated that mir-221 and 222 were able to target pten.

22640741_2	consistent with the data, no decrease in luciferase activity was observed when mir-27a mimics was transfected into hek 293t cells together with the mutant reporter , indicating that the predicted site is a direct target of mir-27a and it is solely responsible for mir-27a targeting of the mouse myostatin 3'utr.

21822301_4	despite the effect of mir-335 on sp1 and bcl-w protein levels, no effect on sp1 and bcl-w mrna levels was detected .
21822301_5	although sp1 and bcl-w are negatively regulated directly by mir-335 in gastric cancer cells, mir-335 has no effect on the sp1 and bcl-w mrna levels detected by qrt-pcr.
21822301_6	these results highlight that mir-335 negatively regulates sp1 and bcl-w expression at the translational level in gastric cancer.

17604720_1	to distinguish between these possibilities, we depleted hotair ncrna by rna interference in primary human fibroblasts, and determined the consequences on the transcriptional landscape of the hox loci.
17604720_2	strikingly, while sirna-mediated depletion of hotair had little effect on transcription of the hoxc locus on chromosome 12 compared to wild-type and control sirna targeting gfp, depletion of hotair lead to dramatic transcriptional activation of the hoxd locus on chromosome 2 spanning over 40 kb, including hoxd8, hoxd9, hoxd10, hoxd11, and multiple ncrnas .
26248649_2	overexpression of mir-200c led to a decrease of cdk2 protein level in both sn12-pm6 and 786-o cells .
26248649_3	conversely, inhibiting mir-200c by using antimir-200c in sn12-pm6 mir-200c and 786-o mir-200c cells led to an increase of cdk2 protein level.
26248649_4	we found that the mir-200c level was inversely correlated with cdk2 expression .
26248649_5	but there was no significant changes in cdk2 mrna level in cell lines and 30 paired tissues , suggesting that cdk2 might be negatively regulated by mir-200c at the post-transcriptional level.
26248649_6	these results strongly suggested that cdk2 was a direct target of mir-200c in the rcc cells.
17996645_1	their studies highlight the micrornas mir-34a and mir-34b c as direct, conserved p53 target genes that presumably mediate induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence by p53.

26741129_2	the results of luciferase assays showed that mir-320a overexpression significantly decreased the luciferase activity of the wt but not that of the mt hoxa10 3'utr compared to that of mir-ctl , confirming that mir-320a directly targets and downregulates hoxa10 in hmscs.
26741129_3	these results suggest that mir-320a inhibits the osteogenic differentiation of hmscs by downregulating its target hoxa10.
24535223_1	notably, overexpression of mir 21 expression was able to restore the inhibition of akt activity, downregulation of bcl2 expression and apoptosis induced by resveratrol.

25144722_1	here, we provide evidence that mir-509-5p, which is downregulated in a subset of newly diagnosed cervical cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma tissues compared with the adjacent nontumor tissue, can be activated by p53 through binding the promoter of mir-509-5p and it suppresses the growth and invasion migration of cervical cancer and hepatoma cells by regulating apoptosis and the g1 s-phase transition of cell cycle.
25144722_2	furthermore, mdm2 was identified to be a target of mir-509-5p by targeting its 3'utr.
25144722_3	restoration of mdm2 abrogated the cell phenotypes induced by mir-509-5p.
25144722_4	moreover, ectopic expression of mir-509-5p in hela and qgy-7703 cells repressed the expression of mdm2, subsequently enhancing its p53-activating effects.
22374218_1	expression analyses indicated that cell cycle factors mps1, cdc37, and pa2g4, and cell junction components cx43 and cldn5, are mir-133 targets during regeneration.
22374218_2	using pharmacological inhibition and egfp sensor interaction studies, we found that cx43 is a new mir-133 target and regeneration gene.
22374218_3	our results indicate that mir-133 is an endogenous inhibitor of cm proliferation through modulation of mps1 and cx43 activity.
22374218_4	these data indicate that regulatory effects of mir-133 on cm proliferation are mediated in part through mps1 and cx43 regulation. in summary, these findings implicate cx43 as a new mir-133 target and key regeneration gene.
22374218_5	zebrafish possess 4 mir-133 family members, mir-133a1, -a2, 133b and mir-133c, differing at most by 2 nucleotides in the 3' region of the mature species.
20861665_1	interestingly, herrera-merchan et al. identified two putative mir-33 binding sites in the 3' untranslated region of the p53 gene and demonstrated that mir-33 transfection represses p53 expression and p53-mediated apoptosis.
20861665_2	these results support the hypothesis that mir-33 promotes the repopulation capacity of hscs by repressing p53, and identify mir-33 as an important negative regulator of p53 that potentially promotes hsc self-renewal.
22370644_3	finally, n-cadherin was identified as a direct target of mir-145.
22370644_4	the 3'utr element of n-cadherin messenger rna is partially complementary to mir-145.

21816906_1	we report that 1,25d markedly induces expression of mir-32 in human myeloid leukemia cells, in which it targets the 3'-untranslated region of the mrna encoding the proapoptotic factor bim to reduce its expression.
26194839_2	this was further confirmed that sox9 was the target gene of mir-101.
25694452_1	moreover, overexpressed mir-1188 promoted apoptosis, enhanced caspase-3 activity, and also upregulated the expression of bax and p53.
25694452_2	mir-1188 directly targeted and negatively regulated bcl-2 and sp1.
25694452_3	silencing of bcl-2 and sp1 exactly copied the proapoptotic and anti-invasive effect of mir-1188, respectively.
25694452_4	meanwhile, the expression of apoptosis and invasion-related genes such as vegfa, fgfr1, and rprd1b was decreased following enhancement of mir-1188, as determined by gene expression profiling analysis.
25015656_2	one predicted upstream regulator was c-fos, which has two confirmed mir-155 binding sites in its 3'utr and, therefore, can be directly regulated by mir-155.
25015656_3	we established that the mir-155 mice had significantly higher levels of c-fos mrna and protein than the c57bl 6 mice at 72 h after cisplatin exposure.
25015656_4	these data indicate a role for mir-155 in the cisplatin response and suggest that targeting of c-fos could be investigated to reduce cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.
24736727_2	when the gscs were co-transfected with the plasmid containing short hairpin rna directed against human sh3gl2 gene and mir-330 mimic, we found that mir-330 promoted the malignant behavior of gscs by down-regulating the expression of sh3gl2.

25826085_1	our results from figure1 showed an inverse relationship between mir-34a and sirt1 in cd44+/cd24- bcscs, suggesting that sirt1 may be a target of mir-34a in bcscs.
25826085_2	as expected, forced expression of mir-34a down-regulated protein expression of sirt1 significantly .
25826085_4	these data suggest that suppressed sirt1 activity by mir-34a could reduce the population of the cd44+/cd24- bcscs.
22064652_1	the direct interaction between mir-126 and adam9 mrna was confirmed by 3' untranslated region assay.
22064652_2	on the basis of these findings, we concluded that adam9 regulates cellular migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells as a targetgene of mir-126.
22064652_3	to confirm that adam9 is a direct target of mir-126, we assessed the expression levels of adam9 in mir-126-transfected panc-1 or aspc-1.
22064652_4	the expression levels of adam9 in mir-126-transfected cells were decreased .

22770245_1	the relative level of mir-31 to its target myf5 mrna therefore falls.
22770245_3	mir-31 targets myf5 mrna, preventing myf5 protein accumulation in the quiescent satellite cell.

26252635_2	pdcd4 protein expression increased after lncap and pc-3 cells were transfected with the mir-21 inhibitor , suggesting that pdcd4 is regulated by mir-21 in these prostate cancer cell lines.
26252635_3	our study also found that pdcd4 is a target of mir-21 regulation in prostate cancer cells.
23761023_1	taken together, all these results strongly suggest that cdk4 is a target of mir-124 in glioma cells.
23761023_2	these observations demonstrate that regulation of cdk4 expression by mir-124 leads to radiosensitization.
23761023_3	thus, cda-2 may exert its radiosensitizing effect on gliomacells, at least in part, through mir-124. in this research, we confirmed by a dual-firefly luciferase reporter assay that cdk4 was a target of mir-124 in glioma cells.
23761023_4	furthermore, we showed that ectopic expression mir-124 downregulated cdk4 expression, which increased the sensitivity to rt. in this study we proved that cda-2 could down-regulate cdk4 by increasing the amount of mir-124.

21441927_1	in an attempt to identify bona fide targets undergoing mir-143- dependent post-transcriptional silencing, we analysed the proteins downregulated on mir-143 overexpression for predicted mir-143 binding sites in their 3' untranslated region .
21441927_2	five proteins exhibited predicted 3'utr binding sites for mir-143, and one of them-namely orp8-had three predicted mir-143 binding sites .
21441927_3	these data indicate that all three binding sites of mir-143 in the 3'utr of orp8 cooperatively confer repression of reporter-gene activity.
21441927_4	taken together, these approaches revealed orp8 as a target for mir-143-dependent posttranscriptional gene silencing.
26458302_2	taken together, it was concluded that mir-144 inhibited migration and proliferation in rectal cancer through the downregulation of rock1. in order to determine whether the inhibitory effects of mir-144 on the progression of rectal cancer are associated with rocks, the present study performed a series of relative experiments, and found that mir-144 inhibits the migration and proliferation of sw837 and sw1463 rectal cancer cells by targeting the crucial oncogene, rock1.

22132158_3	it was found that the siah1a protein expression was increased in both groups , confirming that mir-135a regulated the expression of siah1a.
22467200_1	luciferase reporter assay showed that mir-93 directly targeted sp7 by specifically binding to the targetcoding sequence region of sp7.
22467200_2	this showed that mir-93 regulated osteoblast mineralization by targeting sp7 and sp7 was the very important targetgene of mir-93 in osteoblast mineralization.
22467200_3	these results revealed that mir-93 posttranscriptionally repressed sp7 protein expression.
22467200_4	thus, these results suggested that mir-93 directly targeted sp7 by specifically binding with the targetcds of sp7.

26300412_1	to validate the hypothesis whether mir-497 targets insr in hepatic cells, pmir-insr-3'utr vector and pmir-mutant-insr-3'utr vector were constructed, and dna sequencing confirmed that recombinant vectors had respectively inserted wild insr 3'utr and mutant insr 3'utr these results suggested that mir-497 directly bound to 3'utr of rat insr mrna. in other words, rat insr is the target gene of mir-497.
26300412_2	among the 9 detected mirnas, only elevated mir-497 was negatively correlated with insr expression .
22908221_1	our results suggest a novel role for mir-331-3p and mir-642-5p in the control of prostate cancer cell growth via the regulation of dohh expression and eif5a activity.
22908221_2	the 182 nt element within the 3'utr of dohh is a direct target of both mir-331-3p and mir-642-5p.
22908221_3	using bioinformatic predictions and reporter gene assays, we have identified a 182-nt element within the dohh 3- -untranslated region that contains a number of targetsites for mir-331-3p and mir-642-5p.
22908221_4	taken together, these data indicate that the 182-nt element within the 3'utr of dohh is a direct target of both mir-331-3p and mir-642-5p.
22908221_5	taken together, these results suggest that mir-331-3p and mir-642-5p regulate dohh expression in the prostate by inducing decay of its mrna, resulting in reduced levels of dohh protein.

18077375_1	expression of a luciferase construct containing the targetsite in sufu was repressed when cotransfected with mir-378.
18077375_2	our results suggest that mir-378 transfection enhanced cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis through repression of the expression of two tumor suppressors, sufu and fus-1. in the presence of the 3'utr, the effect of sufu was repressed by mir-378 expression, resulting in high levels of cell survival, confirming that the sufu 3'utr is a target of mir-378.
18077375_3	nevertheless, without mir-378 expression , sufuutr expression exhibited higher rates of cell survival compared with sufu alone.
18077375_6	it acts on two tumor suppressors, sufu and fus-1.
18077375_7	other tumor suppressors may also be involved in mir-378 function, because mir-378 may targetmultiple mrnas.
19472311_1	finally, we tested fndc3b mrna and protein levels in hepg2 with and without mir-143 mimic transfection by way of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting to determine how mir-143 acts through mrna degradation or translational repression.
19472311_2	as shown in fig.4b, fndc3b mrna levels were not significantly affected, whereas protein levels decreased substantially after treatment with mir-143.
19472311_3	these results strongly indicate that fndc3b gene expression is directly translationally suppressed by mir-143.
22891046_1	luciferase assays confirmed that mir-24 suppressed jp2 expression by binding to either of these sites.
22891046_2	in the present study, we report that mir-24, a microrna upregulated in heart failure, is an immediate upstream suppressor of jp2. in the present study, we demonstrated that mir-24 regulates jp2 expression by binding to at least 1 of the 2 sites within the 3'utr of jp2 mrna.
22891046_3	similar results were shared by the rat, mouse and human sequences, indicating that the mir-24 targeting of jp2 expression was doubly-secured through evolution.

21880462_4	the above results indicated that cisplatin might inhibit a549 cell growth by mir-98 regulating tp53 pathway, in which the expression of mir-34 was increased to further reduce bcl-2 expression.
21880462_5	different from precious studies, our results indicated that mir-34 and bcl-2 attend tp53 pathway in a549 cells, which was regulated by mir-98 mir-453.
21880462_6	overall, our results demonstrated that mir-98 and mir-453 down-regulate tp53 expression by targeting the 3'utr of tp53, and also indicate that the signal factors in tp53 pathway are affected in a549 cells after mir-98 and mir-453 treatment.
22664922_1	to test whether mir-29a b manifests its effect on bace1 due to a direct interaction, we used targetscan to predict its binding site in the mouse bace1 3'utr and create a 22 base pair mutation abolishing the mirna binding site.
22223106_4	these results demonstrate that the effect of suboptimal early nutrition and growth on both mir-483-3p and gdf3 protein is conserved between humans and rats.
22223106_5	transfection of mir-483-3p mimic significantly decreased the level of gdf3 endogenous protein , demonstrating that gdf3 expression is regulated by mir-483-3p.
22223106_6	these results demonstrate that both mir-483-3p and gdf3 mrna associate with the risc and that the binding of gdf3 mrna is dependent on mir-483-3p.
22223106_7	taken together, these data confirm the presence of a functional and direct mir-483-3p target site in the 3'-utrs of the mouse, rat and human gdf3 mrna.
23010597_3	these results indicated that mir-134 inhibits emt through regulating foxm1 expression in nsclc cells.
23010597_4	it is also shown that foxm1 is suppressed by mir-134 via direct binding to the foxm1 3'utr.
23010597_5	these results indicate that mir-134 downregulates foxm1 expression by directly targeting its 3'utr.
21956418_2	to validate this target we evaluated the expression of cdk6 protein levels in wro, wropcdh, and wromir-191 cell clones by western blot.
21956418_3	the introduction of mir-191 significantly decreased cdk6 protein level , but not mrna , consistently with a posttranscriptional regulation of the cdk6 protein by this mirna.
21956418_4	therefore, these data show that mir-191 interferes with cdk6 mrna translation by directly interacting with both targetsequences in its 3'utr.
21956418_5	these data suggest that the mir-191 effect is, at least in part, mediated by cdk6 targeting.
21956418_6	these results suggest that mir-191 down-regulation is correlated to cdk6 overexpression in most of the cases.
26618772_1	mir-143 directly targeted seed sequences in the 3 ' -untranslated regions of erk5. in our study, we confirmed that mir-143 expression was experimentally declined in breast cancer specimens, and erk5 was down-regulated directly by mir-143.
26618772_2	these results suggested a direct and specific interaction of mir-143 on erk5 3'utr in breast cancer cells.
26618772_3	taken together, our data suggested that erk5 was a target gene of mir-143.
24750349_1	in conclusion, mir-130a is important for maintaining normal autophagy levels and promoting the survival of epc via regulation of bcl-2 and beclin1 expression, via runx3.

26298724_2	our study demonstrates that mir-148a inhibits the migration of breast cancer cells by targeting mmp-13 and also lays theoretical foundation for further exploration for the function of mir-148a.
26298724_3	furthermore, we also demonstrated that mir-148a regulated the migration of breast cancer cells by targeting mmp-13.
26298724_4	taken together, these results demonstrated that mir-148a reduced the luciferase activity of wild-type 3'utr, but not the mutant type 3'utr of mmp-13, suggesting that mir-148a binds to the 3'utr of mmp-13.
26298724_5	it indicates that mmp-13 is a target of mir-148a.
23133646_1	this study reports for the first time the identification of microrna-574-5p and microrna-921 as two mirnas capable of interacting with the 39-untranslated region of the cbr1 gene and downregulating cbr1 expression.
23133646_2	hsa-mir-574-5p and hsa-mir-921 bind differentially to cbr1 3'utr constructs.
23133646_3	we demonstrated that mir-574-5p and hsa-mir-921 both influence cbr1 protein expression in human cell lines with homozygosis for the major cbr1 1096g.a
26273410_1	by cell transfection and luciferase reporter assay, dab2 was confirmed as a direct target of mir-93.
26273410_2	subsequent experiments in vitro showed that mir-93 could promote the proliferation and migration of escc cells by targeting dab2.
26273410_3	these findings demonstrated that mir-93 could regulate dab2 expression in escc cells. in sum, these results indicate that mir-93 can directly inhibit dab2 expression by targeting its 3'utr, and that there are more obvious changes to the dab2 protein than the mrna level when transfection with mir-93 is performed, suggesting that mir-93 regulates dab2 expression mainly by translational suppression.
21252116_1	interestingly, we also observed a concomitant decrease in expression of the let-7 mirna targetimp-1 by 73%, and cdc34 and total ras, by 30% and 16%, respectively, compared with control cells , suggesting let-7 regulation by c-myc.
21252116_2	however, qrt-pcr showed an increase in both mature let-7a and let-7b mirna expression , suggesting that c-myc modulates expression of known let-7 target, imp-1, cdc34, and ras, in part by negatively regulating endogenous mature let-7 mirna levels in human colon cancer cells.
18801740_1	here we provide evidence in ad brains of a specific up-regulation of an nf-kb-sensitive mirna-146a highly complementary to the 3' un-translated region of complement factor h , an important repressor of the brain's inflammatory response.
18801740_2	up-regulation of mirna-146a coupled to down-regulation of cfh was observed in ad brain and in il-1ss, ass42 and or oxidatively-stressed human neural cells in primary culture.
18801740_3	transfection of hn cells using an nf-kb-containing pre-mirna-146a promoter-luciferase reporter construct in stressed hn cells showed significant up-regulation of luciferase activity that paralleled decreases in cfh gene expression.
18801740_5	incubation of an antisense oligonucleotide to mirna-146a was found to restore cfh expression levels.
18801740_6	these data indicate that nf-kb-sensitive mirna-146a-mediated modulation of cfh gene expression may in part regulate an inflammatory response in ad brain and in stressed hn cell models of ad, and illustrates the potential for anti-mirnas as an effective therapeutic strategy against pathogenic inflammatory signaling.
22883469_1	mir-133b target egfr by binding to the egfr 3'utr.

26867589_1	the 3'utr of pdcd4 contains three binding sites for mir-499 and one for mir-21.
26867589_2	in tonsillar sccs samples, both mir-21 and mir-499 were elevated but the rna levels for pdcd4 was markedly lower.
26867589_3	we also transiently transfected scc003 cells with pdcd4 with and without the 3'utr, and as expected, pdcd4 mrna expression was downregulated by both mir-21 and mir-499 only when the 3'utr was present .
26867589_4	taken together these observations suggest that mir-21 and mir-499 can both regulate the expression of pdcd4.

21844895_1	to confirm whether ppar-gamma is a direct target of mir-27b, we performed luciferase reporter assays in hek293 cells.
21844895_2	cotransfection of mir-27b with the luciferase reporter gene linked to the wild-type 3'utr of ppar-gamma strongly inhibited the luciferase activity, while cotransfection with anti-mir-27b rescued this effect .
21844895_3	we further measured the ppar-gamma expression level in smad4 mutant heart tissues, which showed increased mir-27b levels, and observed that ppar-gamma was significantly decreased in smad4 mutants .
21844895_4	consistently, ppar-gamma levels were significantly reduced in mir-27b transgenic hearts .
21844895_5	figure 6 ppar-gamma is a target of mir-27b in cardiomyocytes.

22232426_1	luciferase assays indicated that mir-34a and mir-449a were less effective in regulating a variant than the wildtype hnf4a 3'utr.

26565624_1	more importantly, hoxb1 was shown experimentally to be a direct target of mir-3175 in this study.
26565624_2	in this study, we suggest that hoxb1 functions as a tumor suppressor gene in glioma and that the expression of hoxb1 is regulated by mir-3175.
26565624_4	in this study, hoxb1 was shown experimentally to be a novel target of mir-3175.
26111662_1	further, overexpression of hsa-mir-218 mimics suppression in protein levels of ptpa , suggesting that mir-218 directly targeted ptpra.
26111662_2	the application of anti-mir-218 restored and mir-218 mimics suppressed the levels of ptpa resulting from era or erb overexpression , suggesting that era and erb differentially regulated ptpa through mir-218. in our study, mir-218 specifically targeted the 3'utr of ptpa, the gene for ptpa, and regulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of gsk-3b and pp2a.
21532345_3	interestingly, two genes that were significantly downregulated were the lncrna neat-1 and a protein coding gene pspc1.
26079880_1	this indicates that mir-139 may suppress the expression of top2a through the binding sequence on its 3'utr region.
26079880_2	to further confirm that top2a is negatively regulated by mir-139, we used a lentiviral delivery system to overexpress mir-139 in tumor cells.

22386953_3	our study identified for the first time that ar is posttranscriptionally regulated by mir-124a in thyroid cancer tissues. in other words, those cases that had an inconsistency between ar mrna with ar protein had a positive correlation with mir-124a, suggesting a possible role of mir-124a in regulating the posttranscriptional processing of ar.
22386953_4	testosterone was not able to restore the inhibitory effect of mir-124a on ar luciferase activity, while it reversed the inhibitory effect of flutamide, suggesting that mir-124a is more efficient in inhibiting ar than flutamide.

20935678_2	we introduced these p53 constructs and mirnas into human lung adenocarcinoma p53-null h1299 cells and found that both mir-25 and mir-30d down-regulated the expression of the ectopic p53 gene with a wt 3'utr .
20935678_3	these results suggest that mir-25 and mir-30d regulate cellular senescence through down-regulating p53 expression and subsequently the expression of p21 and that such regulation depends on mirna binding sites of tp53 3'utr.
20935678_4	taken together, these data suggest that dysregulation of mir-25 and mir-30d is pathologically important to p53 function in h929 cells.
25470111_2	ctnnd1 was proved to be a direct target gene for mir-145.

22915757_1	here, we report that the metastasis-associated microrna mir-10b directly binds the 3' untranslated region of micb and downregulates its expression.
22915757_2	as can be seen in fig.2b, a moderate, yet significant decrease in luciferase activity was observed in the presence of mir-10b, whereas the mutations in the 3'utr of micb abolished this effect, indicating that mir-10b indeed directly target micb at the predicted binding site.
22915757_3	therefore, we concluded that mir-10b specifically controls micb expression.
22915757_4	thus, we concluded that targeting of micb by mir-10b leads to a specific reduction of micb expression and consequently to reduced killing by nk cells.

14744852_1	taken together, these data indicate that, during prolonged hypoxia, hif-alpha proteins negatively regulate hif-1alpha expression through an increase in ahif and destabilization of hif-1alpha mrna.
14744852_3	binding of ahif to the hif-1alpha mrna 3'utr could expose au-rich elements present in the hif-1alpha mrna 3'utr and thus possibly increase the degradation speed of hif-1alpha mrna .

20473940_4	these data suggest that mir-137 negatively regulates invasion of the colorectal cancer cells, and this may, at least in part, be due to its targeting effect on cdc42.
26142856_3	overall, increased presence of mir-24 in the extracellular environment leads to higher expression of mir-24 within embryos and results in decreased expression of a mir-24 mrna target.
23236518_1	further, several micrornas , specifically mir-1798, mir-1699, mir-223 and mir-1744 were discovered to influence expression of ccnd1, ccne2, cdk1, and cdk3 mrnas, respectively, via their 3'utr which suggests that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression influences their expression in laying hens.
23236518_2	moreover, mir-1626 influenced cdkn1a expression and mir-222, mir-1787 and mir-1812 regulated cdkn1b expression via their 3'utr regions.

20736365_3	these results support the functional link between mir-196 and hoxc8.
20736365_4	these results thus show that the ratio of mir-196s to hoxc8 mrna, rather than the levels of mir-196s or hoxc8 mrna, reflect the migration status of a particular cell line.
20736365_5	these results suggest that the ratio of mir-196s to hoxc8 mrna may be specifically correlated with the metastasis status of breast tumors.

21546206_1	this study demonstrates the inverse relationship between mir-21 and pdcd4, thus suggesting that mir-21 post-transcriptionally modulates pdcd4 via mrna degradation.
21546206_3	prior to this, despite the perfect complementarity between mir-21 and its targetsite at the 3' -utr of the pdcd4 gene, there had been no convincing data to support the hypothesis that mir-21 downregulates pdcd4 by mrna degradation.
21546206_4	the present study conducted on 49 tumour and 61 normal tissues, clearly demonstrated a strong inverse correlation between mir-21 and pdcd4-mrna expression, thus providing evidence that mir-21 may post-transcriptionally downregulate pdcd4 through the mechanism of mrna degradation.

26545119_2	steady-state smad2 mrna levels were not significantly changed in kshv infected tive cells, compared to mock infected cells.
26545119_5	this indicates that the mir-17-92 cluster led to down-regulation of smad2 by mainly inhibiting translation.
26545119_6	in summary, vflip and vcyclin contribute to inhibition of tgf--beta signaling by transcriptionally activating the mir-17-92 cluster, which results in decreased translation of smad2 mrna.
26545119_7	smad2 expression and the response to tgf--beta were restored by antagomir against the mir-17, 18a, and 20. this indicates that the mir-17-92 cluster led to down-regulation of smad2 by mainly inhibiting translation.

26807179_1	bioinformatics analyses showed that mir-214 bound to 3'utr of -beta-catenin mrna in ec cells to inhibit its translation.
26807179_2	together, these data demonstrate that mir-214 targets 3'utr of -beta-catenin mrna to inhibit its translation in ec cells, and loss of mir-214 in ec may result in increases in -beta-catenin, and subsequently enhanced wnt signaling in ec cells.
26807179_3	together, these data suggest that mir-214 suppresses -beta-catenin protein, but not -beta-catenin gene transcription in ec cells.

19638978_3	the relative luciferase activity of the wt construct of dnmt3a 3'utr in both the colon cancer cells was significantly reduced in the presence of mir-143 , whereas such a suppressive effect of mir-143 on luciferase activity was not observed in both cells with the mut construct of dnmt3a 3'utr , highlighting a direct and specific interaction of mir-143 on dnmt3a 3'utr.
21455217_1	in addition, myb can inhibit mir-148a by directly acting on the transcription factor binding site in mir-148a gene and mir-148a can posttranscriptionally silence bcl-2.
21455217_2	the levels of bcl-2 protein were clearly reduced in mir-148a-overexpressing rko and lovo cells compared with control cells .

26432332_2	taken together, these findings suggested that mir-92a could promote growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance in nsclc cells at least partially by targeting pten.
26432332_3	these results indicate that pten is a mir-92a target in nsclc. in addition, we also found that mir-92a can enhance proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemoresistance of nsclc via targeting the 3'utr of pten.

19135980_2	we found that mir-15b could significantly downregulate ccne1 protein levels but not its mrna levels, suggesting that ccne1 is a potential functional target of mir-15b.
19135980_3	lastly, results from our dual-luciferase reporter assays suggest that ccne1 is one of the functional downstream target of mir-15b.
21618527_1	furthermore, up-regulation of mir-22 could suppress the protein level of pten and reduction of mir-22 level markedly increased the protein level of pten in cardiomyocytes by western blot analysis, suggesting that the contribution of mir-22 to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy may be partially through targeting pten.
21618527_2	using luciferase assay, we showed that overexpression of mir- 22 in 293t cells could significantly suppress the luciferase activity of a reporter fused with 30 utr of pten mrna .
21618527_3	to investigate whether the expression of pten was suppressed by mir-22 in cardiomyocytes, western blot was used to analyze pten protein level.
21618527_4	the results showed that overexpression of mir-22 in cardiomyocytes significantly down-regulated pten expression level, while inhibition of endogenous mir-22 level markedly increased pten protein level .

21596753_1	we have established the sirt1 transcript as subject to regulation by mir-200a, through mir-200a targeting of sirt1 3'utr.
21596753_3	4b shows that mir-200a inhibits the luciferase activity of the wild-type sirt1 3'utr, but mutation of the mir-200a mirna-responsive element within the sirt1 3'utr abolishes mir-200a action, suggesting that mir-200a target one complementary sequence in the sirt1 3'utr. in fig.
21596753_4	4d , western blot analysis shows that mir-200a is unable to alter sirt1 protein expression when cells are transfected with sirt1 construct lacking a 3'utr, supporting that mir-200a reduces sirt1 expression by targeting the sirt1 3'utr.
21596753_5	these findings further confirmed a functional role for sirt1 in promoting emt-like transformation of mammary epithelial cells as well as establishing a role for mir-200a in inhibiting this process.
21596753_6	in support of our in vitro findings, mir-200a down-regulation in tissue samples of breast cancer correlates with the high levels of sirt1 overexpression observed by immunohistochemistry.

22249264_1	luciferase reporter assays confirmed direct binding of mir-29b to the id1 3'utr.
22249264_2	these results demonstrate that mir-29b directly inhibits the id1 3'utr, thereby reducing id1 expression.
22249264_3	figure 2 mir-29b target the id1 3'utr.
22249264_4	thus, the effect of mir-29b on cell migration and invasion is mainly mediated by id1.
25501203_1	we found negative relationships between mir-486 and forkhead box 1, and mir-133a and serum response factor at all developmental stages, suggesting that forkhead box 1 and serum response factor are potential targets of mir-486 and mir-133a, respectively.
25501203_3	mir-133 is mainly expressed during embryogenesis and promotes muscle cell proliferation by directly repressing the expression of srf.
25501203_5	in addition, foxo1 is a target of mir-486 , and they jointly participate in protein degradation.
25501203_6	the decreasing level of mir-486 with age suggests an increasing expression level of foxo1, which may promote muscle atrophy during the later stages of pig muscle development.
26464659_1	in addition, our results of western blot showed that inhibition of mir-25 significantly increased the protein level of fbxw7, while overexpression of mir-25 significantly reduced the protein level of fbxw7 .3d. these data suggest that fbxw7 is a direct target of mir-25.

24260215_2	furthermore, we identified b-catenin as the functional downstream target of mir-200a, and activation of the wnt b-catenin pathway is responsible, at least partially, for mir-200a-silencing-mediated biological functions in wb-f344 cells.
24260215_3	taken together, our data indicate that ctnnb1 mrna is a direct target of mir-200a, and knockdown of mir-200a could activate, at least in part, the wnt/-beta-catenin signaling pathway in wb cells.

21685371_3	figure 2 mir-29a binds 3'utr of ski and is associated with low ski expression in primary aml cells.
21118966_2	as expected, all 4 tumor cell lines tested with the egr1-3'utr reporter showed 2- to 10-fold decrease in luciferase activity in comparison to the control cells , supporting our hypothesis that mir-183 can potentially regulate egr1.
21118966_3	the modified reporter mimic combination with perfect base pairing led to significant decreases in reporter activity, confirming the existence of a direct interaction between mir-183 and the 3'utr of egr1 .
21118966_4	these results suggest that mir-183 affects both egr1 mrna transcript levels as well as egr1 protein levels via translational regulation.
26627200_1	furthermore, mir-152 expression could be inhibited by tgf--beta, and the negative post-transcriptionally regulation of mir-152 on hla-g was also demonstrated through gain- and loss-of-function studies.
26627200_2	and, results from luciferase assay showed that hla-g 3'utr was also negatively regulated by mir-152, while no obvious regulation on mut-hla-g 3'utr was observed at the same time .
26627200_3	in this study, we validated that hla-g expression was repressed by mir-152 while mir-152 expression was also inhibited by tgf--beta induction in gc cell lines.
21079996_1	direct targeting of mir-138 to two candidate binding sequences located in the 3'-untranslated region of gnai2 mrna was confirmed using luciferase reporter gene assays.
21079996_2	these results suggest that mir-138 regulates gnai2 gene expression, at least in part, by regulating the stability of gnai2 mrna.
21079996_4	3d, ectopic transfection of mir-138 reduced the protein level of gnai2 in um1 cells.

22479456_2	these findings confirm mir-34a regulates pdgfra transcript through direct interactions with its 3'utr.
22479456_3	our findings indicate that proneural gliomas are specifically characterized by mir-34a downregulation with subsequent derepression of the mirna-檚 downstream target pdgfra, a process that promotes tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo.
17957028_1	from this, we conclude that the mir-130a consensus binding sequences in the gax 3'utr mediate the down-regulation of gax by mitogens and proangiogenic factors.
22277001_1	we further demonstrate that mir-125b targeted the 3'-untranslated region of lin28 and reduced the abundance of lin28 at both mrna and protein levels.
22277001_2	these results suggest that lin28 might be regulated by mir-125b and play an important role in mesc differentiation.
22277001_3	these data suggest that the targeting of lin28 by mir-125b is conserved in mescs.
22277001_4	the repression of lin28 during differentiation of mescs is, at least in part, regulated by mir-125b.
22277001_5	these results demonstrate that lin28 is intimately involved in the cell lineage speci- fication of mescs and accounts for the mesendodermal commitment when mir-125b is deregulated.
18413726_1	taken together, these data show that imp-1 protein expression is under control of endogenous let-7.
18413726_2	we also determined that this regulation requires the 3'utr of imp-1 because let-7 and the lna inhibitor had opposite effects on the expression of luciferase when they were cotransfected into cells together with a fusion construct of luciferase and the imp-1 3'utr .
18413726_4	mutation of either of these two lcs significantly inhibited luciferase repression by let-7.
18413726_5	c, imp-1 is posttranscriptionally regulated through the 3'utr by let-7.
18413726_6	taken together, these data show that, similar to hmga2, imp-1 protein expression is under control of endogenous let-7 through targeting lcs in its 3'utr.
18413726_7	these data suggest that imp-1 is one of the major target of let-7g that regulate growth of these cells and are consistent with let-7g causing growth reduction through reduction of imp-1 expression, which then indirectly affects expression of cell cycle regulators.
19471102_1	mir-125b expression affects the proliferation and apoptosis of human glioma cells by targeting bmf.
25576058_1	moreover, after mutating the two mir-34a target sites within the notch 3'utr in the reporter plasmid, no effect of mir-34a on luciferase signal was observed , indicating that the inhibition of luciferase activity seen in the notch + mir-34a condition is due to direct binding of mir-34a to notch in panc02 cells.
25576058_2	metformin reduced glucose and insulin levels and expression of mir-34a and its direct targets notch, slug, and snail.
26382295_1	the proven or postulated mrna targets of mirna-21 respond to lps by one of 2 distinct patterns: 1 a sharp decrease, followed by a prolonged period of down-regulation ; or 2 an immediate robust rise and subsequent return to baseline with a sustained period of down-regulation .

26753959_3	these results indicate that mir-320 negatively regulates mcl-1 expression by binding to the 3'utr of mcl-1.
18347095_2	therefore, the same element that we demonstrated above to present ires activity in the zeb2 rna is also relevant for nat transcription.
18347095_3	we also determined whether expression of the zeb2 nat was determinant for the conservation of the intron in the 5- -utr.
18347095_5	as shown in figure 6b, expression of this nat induced the maintenance of the intron in the 5- -utr of endogenous zeb2 mrna.
18347095_6	these results suggest the levels of the nat control zeb2 5- -utr splicing in these cell lines.
22251626_1	to confirm the fact that 3'utr of ccr7 is a direct target of let-7a, a luciferase assay for the reporter gene expressing the let-7a binding sites of ccr7 3'utr was used.
22251626_2	among the targetproteins, ccr7 showed a significant reverse correlation with let-7a expression, suggesting that ccr7 could be regulated by let-7a in breast cancer cells.
22251626_4	these experiments showed that let-7a regulates ccr7 and cell motility, dependent on ccl21 expressions.
22251626_5	the result suggests that let-7a directly regulates ccr7 protein expression through interaction with the 3'utr of ccr7.
22251626_6	collectively, the data suggest that the zebrafish embryo model can be used to monitor the migration of breast cancer cells in a living animal, and let-7a overexpression or ccr7 silencing could cause a significant reduction in breast cancer cell migration in vivo.
22120719_1	in neuroblastoma cells, mir-27b target the 3' untranslated region of ppargamma and inhibits its mrna and protein expression. in addition, ppargamma protein levels are decreased upon overexpression of mir-27b and increased upon addition of antisense against mir-27b .
22120719_2	lastly, in 10-day old tumors generated by injection of sk-n-as cells in nude mice, ppargamma mrna expression is reduced 3-fold in tumors injected intra-tumorally with mir-27b, but not with the control mirna .
22120719_3	thus, mir-27b inhibits ppargamma expression in neuroblastomas cells.
22120719_4	thus, mir-27b and ppargamma regulate the inflammatory response in neuroblastoma cells.
19826008_3	4a, bdnf, ptpn1, and p4hb were down-modulated following mir-210 overexpression and induced when mir-210 was inhibited .

26823729_2	as shown in figure 5a, the fluorescence activity was significantly increased by dysregulation of mir-29b , suggesting that kif1b could be directly regulated by mir-29b.
26823729_3	these results indicated that mir-29b could regulate the expression of kif1b at the post transcriptional level.
26823729_4	moreover, we found that mir-29b promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis resistance by repression of kif1b expression.
26282218_3	meanwhile,nrf2 expression was downregulated around 2-fold at mrna level, as well as ho-1 and nqo1 at protein level thereby, it was concluded that nrf2 was negatively modulated by mir-34a, including both nrf2-3'utr activity and nrf2 expression.
18417479_1	mir-210 inhibits efna3 expression directly.
18417479_2	we determined that one relevant target of mir-210 in hypoxia was ephrin-a3 since mir-210 was necessary and sufficient to down-modulate its expression.
18417479_3	moreover, luciferase reporter assays showed that ephrin-a3 was a direct target of mir-210.
18417479_4	afterward, it was investigated whether mir-210 up-regulation in the absence of hypoxia regulated efna3 levels.

26333672_6	however, mir-34c had a significant negative correlation with pdgfra , suggesting that pdgfra gene may be a true target gene of mir-34c.
26333672_7	furthermore, the detected protein expression of pdgfra show that it is differentially expressed at different developmental stages of testis, which is consistent with the results detected by fluorescence quantitative pcr. the following results of immunohistochemistry sections showed that the expression levels of pdgfra in 2-days and 3-month were significantly higher than in 4-months and 5-months, which is consistent with the earlier results and provided further evidence that pdgfra was a target gene of mir-34c. in addition, the expression of mir-34c was upregulated rapidly indicating that mi-34c was important for the growth of seminiferous tubules.
26221902_2	therefore, these results highlight the significance of mir-206 as a tumor suppressor in lscc growth in part by targeting cyclind2.
26641802_1	in vitro studies confirmed that lentivirus-mir-33 overexpression repressed both abca1 and abcg1 in cultured murine alveolar macrophages.
26641802_2	bal cells of sarcoidosis patients also displayed elevated mir-33 together with reduced abca1 and abcg1 mrna and protein compared to healthy controls.
26641802_4	findings suggest that alveolar macrophage mir-33 is upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and may perpetuate chronic inflammatory granulomatous disease by repressing anti-inflammatory functions of abca1 and abcg1 lipid transporters.

20563308_2	taken together these experiments provide evidence that mir-263a acts directly via the sites identified in the 3'utr to regulate hid mrna levels in vivo.
19542014_2	recently, we have found that microrna mir-145 is the most abundant mirna in normal vascular walls and in freshly isolated vsmcs; however, the role of mir-145 in vsmc phenotypic modulation and vascular diseases is currently unknown.
19542014_5	vsmc differentiation marker genes such as sm alpha-actin, calponin, and sm-mhc are upregulated by premir-145 or adenovirus expressing mir-145 but are downregulated by the mir-145 inhibitor 2'ome-mir-145.

23526568_2	these data highlighted that mir-195 interacts with the bcl2l2 mrna and represses its expression especially through the first binding site.
23526568_3	these results suggest that mir-195 play an important role in regulating doxorubicin chemosensitivity directly through adjustment of anti-apoptosis activity by targeting bcl2l2 in colon cancer cells.
23526568_4	our study demonstrated that suppression of mir-195 leads to elevation of its direct targetgene bcl2l2 expression therefore makes the human colon cancer cells more resistant to doxorubicin.
23526568_5	bcl2l2 is a direct target of mir-195, which specifically interacts with the first potential binding site of bcl2l2 mrna 3'utr.

21159815_1	these assays point to sugarbabe as a functionally important mir-14 target in the ipcs.
21159815_2	this indicates that endogenous levels of mir-14 are sufficient to negatively regulate gene expression via the sugarbabe 3'utr in the ipcs in vivo.
21159815_4	because s2 cells endogenously express mir-14, we asked whether depleting mir-14 would lead to elevated expression of the luciferase reporters.
21159815_5	these results suggest that mir-14 can act directly via the predicted target site to regulate sugarbabe levels.
23028672_1	finally, we utilized both luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis to identify bnip3 as a direct target of mir-145.
21062975_1	mir-302-mediated antiproliferation functions through cosuppression of cdk2, cyclin d1 d2, and bmi-1.
21062975_3	we found that mir-302 over a certain threshold concentration is able to inactivate both complexes through simultaneous suppression of cdk2 and cyclin d1 d2 activities.
21062975_5	different cellular conditions may affect the way of mirna-mrna interaction to change the preference of mirna-mediated gene targeting.
21062975_6	however, there is currently no report related to either the dose-dependent effect of mir-302 or the stringency of mir-302-targetinteraction. our study provides important insights on these issues and, for the first time, revealed that mir-302 functions differently between humans and mice.
20029046_2	our data showed that retinoic acid induction in nb4 cells led to up-regulation of mir-223 and down-regulation of e2f1 protein .

18573883_2	since the putative hsa-mir-519c site has been validated for abcg2 3'utr in s1 cells, we repeated the 3'race assay, using s1 cells transfected with the specific hsa-mir-519c inhibitor.
18573883_3	we used the specific hsa-mir-519c inhibitor to increase the level of abcg2 3'utr in s1 cells and subsequently confirmed the long sequence in s1 cells and its absence in s1mi80 cells with a nested pcr 1 and nested pcr 2 .
18573883_4	interestingly, the perfect pairing of hsa-mir-519c with the hsa-mir-519c complementary sequence led to the most substantial degradation of abcg2 mrna.
20299448_1	we demonstrate a direct role for mir-23a b in the dramatic postnatal down-regulation of cugbp and etr-3-like factor proteins that regulate nearly half of developmentally regulated splicing transitions in the heart.
20299448_2	there are three conserved mir-23a b seed matches in the 3'utr of cugbp1 and two in cugbp2 .
20299448_3	these data indicate that postnatal up-regulation of mir-23a b suppresses cugbp1 and cugbp2 protein expression in adult hearts via direct binding to their respective 3'-utrs, resulting in a physiological shift in the alternative splicing of a subset of splicing events.
20299448_4	these results demonstrate a direct functional interaction between mir-23b and each of these regions within the 3'utr of cugbp1 and cugbp2.
26823753_1	serum and glucocorticoid regulated protein kinase 3 was predicted as the target gene for mir-155, and mir-155 expression was negatively correlated to sgk3 expression.

25879024_1	besides, the expression level of mir-21 and its potential target sox-2 were also detected 3 days after osteogenic induction; the results showed that sox-2 decreased as the increase of mir-21 abundance, indicating that there was a negative correlation between mir-21 and sox-2 .
21219636_1	these results suggest that mir-21 directly target ankrd46 in bc cells.
21219636_2	ankrd46 3'utr showed a reduction to 54.8% of total luciferase reporter activity, in presence of mir-21, but eif4a2 3'utr did not display significant reduction of luciferase levels, compared with the mir-control .
21219636_3	these results suggest that mir-21 directly target ankrd46 in bc cells. in addition, ankrd46 is newly identified as a direct target of mir-21 in bc.
25620738_1	to confirm these findings, hbx and mirna-30a were coexpressed in hepg2 cells, and the results showed significant inhibition of autophagosome formation and beclin-1 and c-myc expression,
25868860_2	these data verify that sox17 induces mir-371-5p expression and consequently suppresses its direct target sox2.
26299922_1	thus, these results confirmed that notch1 was a direct target of mir-139-5p in breast cancer cells.
26299922_2	these data suggest that downexpression of mir-139-5p increases the chemosensitivity to docetaxel to induce apoptosis via notch1 targeting in breast cancer cells.
26299922_3	taken together, these results also demonstrate that notch1 is a direct and functional mediator of mir-139-5p.
26299922_4	these data further confirmed that mir-139-5p targets notch1.
23873935_1	puma is a target of mir-149. in follow-up functional analysis, our results showed that the mir-149 suppressed apoptosis through targeting the pro-apoptotic protein puma.
23873935_2	these data indicate that mir-149 directly regulates puma expression, and the snp rs71428439 is able to influence the effect of pre-mir-149 on the expression levels of puma.
26044523_1	mir-24-3p directly targets and inhibits p27kip1 protein expression.
26044523_2	mir- 24-3p directly targets the 3'utr of p27kip1 and suppresses its expression.
20620960_1	conversely, the inhibition of endogenous mir-200 in hct116 cells with anti-mir lna200 led to an increase in fap-1 and a decrease in e-cadherin expression , strongly suggesting that mir-200c directly target fap-1.
20620960_2	interestingly, fap-1 mrna levels did not change with the introduction of mir-200c or with the inhibition of mir-200 as determined by semi-quantitative rt-pcr .
20620960_3	therefore, fap-1 is a target of mir-200c, and regulation of fap-1 is due to translational repression and not mrna degradation.
20620960_4	this indicated that the mir-200c effect on cd95 directed apoptosis is mediated by repression of fap-1.
23754622_1	to determine whether these sites can be targeted by mir-124, we cloned luciferase reporter constructs encompassing either 1,410 bps of the mouse usp14 3'utr or 257 bps of mouse usp24 3'utr that contain the mir-124 binding sites .
23754622_2	fig. 4 mir-124 suppresses expression of reporter constructs containing 3'utr sequences from mouse usp14 and mouse usp24. in contrast to rat neurons, hek cells lack endogenous mir-124 expression , and as mentioned, the human usp14 sequence has two additional mir-124 binding sites; this most likely add to the more pronounced suppression of usp14 by mir-124 observed in the human cell line.
22867989_3	pre-mir-126 strongly reduced the expression of p85-beta bearing its 3'utr compared to pre-mir-scramble, but did not modify the expression of p85-beta lacking its own 3'utr .
22867989_4	these results were also confirmed in ec transfected with the lna-anti-mir-126, which showed a higher amount of p85-beta protein compared to ec transfected with control lna .
21971048_1	we recently demonstrated that the 3'-untranslated region of erbb-2 mrna contains two specific targetsites for binding of the microrna mir-331-3p and that mir-331-3p represses erbb-2 expression and signaling in pca cells.
21971048_2	our previous work indicated that mir-331-3p regulates erbb-2 expression in pca cells via its interaction with two specific targetsites in the erbb-2 3'utr , one of which is immediately distal to the erbb-2-ure .
21971048_3	we investigated whether hur could antagonize the ability of mir-331-3p to down-regulate erbb-2 expression in pca cells.
21971048_4	thus, hur binding to the wild-type erbb-2 ure does not prevent mir-331-3p binding to its adjacent seed , although the spacing between the two sites may be critical for the regulatory outcome .
21971048_5	this result indicates that loss of hur binding to the erbb-2 3'utr ure increases the repressive action of mir-331-3p upon erbb-2 mrna.
21347332_1	interestingly, the 3'utr of the rhob mrna was found to contain one predicted binding site for mir-21 conserved between several species , which suggest that rhob might be a direct target of mir-21.
21347332_2	moreover, rhob was reported very recently to be targeted by mir-21 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.
21347332_3	in huvecs, overexpression of mir-21 significantly decreased the level of rhob mrna expression .
21347332_4	by contrast, inhibition of mir-21 expression increased rhob mrna.
21347332_5	taken together, these results indicate that mir-21 regulates the expression level of active rhob in endothelial cells.
21347332_6	altogether these data confirmed the mir-21-dependent regulation of rhob and its implication in the migrating properties of huvecs.
26175947_3	these data suggested that mir-497 bound directly to specific site in the 3'utr of ikk-beta mrna.
26175947_4	next, it was determined whether endogenous expression of ikk-beta could be downregulated by mir-497.
26175947_5	to address this issue, western blot analysis was used to evaluate the expression of ikk-beta at the protein level after transfection with mir-497 mimics and nc inpc3-ar cells.
26175947_6	the results showed that the overexpression of mir-497 significantly decreased the expression levels of ikk-beta protein .
26175947_7	collectively, these luciferase and western blot results showed that mir-497 acted as negative regulators of expression of ikk-beta.
22068596_1	in addition, we show that the histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 , a transcriptional co-repressor of nuclear receptor tlx, is a downstream target of mir-137.
22068596_2	these results indicate that mir-137 represses lsd1 expression through the predicted targetsite in the lsd1 3'utr.
22068596_3	the expression of lsd1 is reduced dramatically in mir-137-rfp-electropoarted cells, compared to control rna and rfp-electroporated cells , providing in vivo evidence that mir-137 target lsd1 expression.
22068596_4	these results strongly suggest that mir-137 regulates neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation in embryonic brains through targeting lsd1 expression by base-pairing to its 3'utr.
26823769_1	in this study, we have confirmed that, as the myocardial hypertrophy gene, mtor was a target gene of mir-96, who would promote the occurrence of myocardial hypertrophy.
26823769_2	next, we implemented fluorescent report carrier assay for deep analysis and finally confirmed that mir-96 was directly binding to 3'utr of mtor .
26823769_3	overall, we can conclude that mtor is the direct target gene of mir-96.
26823769_4	by using bioinformatics method and the fluorescent report carrier assay, we finally identified that mtor was the target gene of mir-96.

23518389_2	results suggest that creg is a functional targetgene of mir-31, and is involved in mir-31-mediated vsmc phenotypic modulation. in the present study, computational analysis suggested that mir-31 bound the creg mrna 3'utr.
23518389_3	the negative correlation between creg expression and mir-31 expression in vsmcs stimulated by either pdgf or serum starvation indicated that mir-31 could potentially regulate the creg gene in vsmcs.
23518389_4	we confirmed that creg protein levels were regulated by the mir-31 mimic and inhibitor in cultured vsmcs.
23544605_2	microrna expression changes in cvb3-infected mice were analyzed by real-time pcr and mir-21 was found to be the mirna whose expression was significantly reduced.

26840372_4	these results demonstrate that vegf-a mrna is a specific target of mir-497 in hct116 crc cells.
26840372_5	figure 3. vegf-a is a direct and functional target of mir-497.
23348698_1	further studies demonstrated that mir-206 could suppress gc cells proliferation at least partially through targeting the cyclind2 .
23348698_3	although ccnd2 expression has been reported to be the repressed by mir-206 in rhabdomyosarcoma, our luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that ccnd2 was target gene of mir-206 in gc.
23348698_4	these data supported the hypothesis that ccnd2 is direct target of mir-206.

26656176_3	taken together, these data strongly reveal that mir-340 directly targets ezh2 expression in hep-2 cells.
26656176_4	accordingly, these results support the hypothesis that mir-340 may act as a tumor suppressor through elevating tumor suppressor gene p27 expression and suppressing pi3k akt signaling activation by targeting ezh2 expression, resulting in an inhibition of lscc progression.
25222737_1	down-regulation of the tir1 and afb2 receptors by mir393
26776158_2	additionally, we found that mir-29b targets the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine dioxygenase, tet1 for downregulation and has downstream effects on tet1-mediated epigenetic modifications.
26776158_3	taken together, these results indicate that mir-29b targets tet1 for downregulation through an interaction with the tet1 3'utr.
26776158_4	we provide mechanistic evidence that mir-29b directly downregulates tet1 expression .
26293467_3	in this study, we demonstrate that mir-15b 16 promotes vsmc contractile phenotype, at least in part, by targeting yap, and therefore, restoring expression of mir-15 16 would be a potential therapeutic approach for treatment of proliferative vascular taken together, these data indicate that mir-15b 16 promotes sm contractile phenotype through directly targeting yap.
26386726_1	interestingly, over-expression of mir-31 mimic in a2780 cells leads to a significant decrease in kcnma1 mrna levels .
26386726_2	this was also reflected in a decrease in kcnma1 protein levels , suggesting that mir-31 is able to inhibit the expression of the kcnma1 gene.
20460403_1	rhob is directly targeted by mir-21.
20460403_2	western blot analysis of rhob expression revealed that knockdown of mir-21 led to an increase of 10%, 80%, and 20% in rhob protein expression in huh-7, hepg2, and mda-mb-231 cells, respectively .
20460403_4	this increase was comparable with mrna rhob level induced by mir-21 inhibitor treatment .
15466020_1	the gady gene was shown to overlap the 3 end of the gadx gene, and this overlap region was found to be necessary for the gady-dependent accumulation of gadx mrna.
15466020_2	we suggest that during stationary phase, gady forms base pairs with the 3 -untranslated region of the gadx mrna and confers increased stability, allowing for gadx mrna accumulation and the increased expression of downstream acid resistance genes.

26314494_3	4b,c, overexpression of mir-190a inhibited yb-1 wild-type, but not mutant luciferase reporter activities in lncap and 22rv1 cells, indicating that mir-190a specifically targets yb-1 through direct 3'utr binding.

22158906_2	collectively, our results demonstrate that brca2 is a bona fide target of mir-1245.
22158906_3	these results suggest that the gain of mir-1245 function leads to a phenotype similar to that with the loss of brca2.

22025269_4	these results suggested that 3'utr of human c-myb gene contains target sites specific for mir-150.
22025269_5	western blot analysis was performed to determine the effect of overexpression of mir-150 on c-myb protein expression.
22025269_6	the results demonstrated that overexpression of mir-150 in cd133+ cells significantly decreased c-myb protein expression, while the mir-control or blank control had no effect on expression of c-myb protein .
22025269_7	rt-pcr analysis demonstrated that mir-150 has little if any effect on c-myb mrna levels .
22391672_1	in addition to mir-199*, let-7b was identified, which directly targets the ns5b coding region and 5 gutr sequences of the hcv genome, resulting in a decrease in hcv replicon replication, downregulation of hcv accumulation, and reduction of hcv infectivity.
19520829_1	both mir-222 and -339 are down-regulated in dicer-disrupted cells and directly interacted with the 3' untranslated region of icam-1 mrna.
19520829_2	these data suggest that mir-222 and -339 down-regulate icam-1 expression at posttranscriptional levels by binding to the icam-1 3'utr.
21857668_1	only mir-279 repressed expression of a reporter gene fused to the stat 3'utr .
21857668_2	overexpression of mir-279 did not repress expression of a mutant stat 3'utr reporter gene lacking the mir-279 seed-binding site .
21857668_3	furthermore, knock-down of endogenous mir-279 using a 2- -o-methyl mir-279 antagomir increased stat 3'utr reporter activity in s2 cells, whereas control antagomirs did not .
21857668_4	thus, mir-279 directly targeted stat via its 3'utr.
21857668_5	although the upd 3'utr contained one putative mir-279 site, the upd 3'utr reporter did not respond to mir-279overexpression .
21857668_6	thus, mir-279 targets the jak stat signaling pathway by repressing stat.
21857668_7	taken together, these results demonstrated that mir-279 repressed stat protein expression and activity in vivo.
21857668_8	taken together, these results indicate that stat is a functional target of mir-279 in vivo.

26259653_4	when compared with that in the control group , indicating that ror2 is a direct target gene of mir-124.
26259653_5	ror2 is significantly upregulated in os cell lines and is negatively regulated by mir-124.
18758960_2	on the other hand, down-regulation of let-7a by the anti-let-7a inhibitor increased the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in a431 parent cells, a10a cells and hepg2 cells while the increase was suppressed by caspase-3 inhibitor.
18758960_4	therefore, let-7a by targeting caspase-3 may play a functional role in modulating drug-induced cell death in human cancer cells.
22876288_1	mir-7 decreases fak expression by directly targeting its 3'utr.
22876288_3	these results indicate that mir-7 expression is inversely correlated with fak expression and activation in breast cancer cell lines and that mir-7 directly regulates fak expression.

21622730_5	furthermore, multiple lines of evidence point to the role of mir-34a repression in the expansion of tumor-initiating cells and that restitution of mir-34a expression depletes this subpopulation in cancers . in turn, mature mir-143 and mir-145 repress kras2 and rreb1, respectively, effectively completing the loop.
21622730_6	therefore, restitution of mir-143 145 expression in miapaca-2 xenografts should attenuate expression of both kras2 and rreb1.
21622730_8	in addition, resultant downregulation of rreb1 protein expression could be observed through immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections from both mir-143 145 nanovector-treated and vehicle control xenografts .
21622730_9	this serves as important in vivo confirmation of the aforementioned feed-forward pathway and indicates that treatment with the systemic mir-143 145 nanovector results in restitution of mature mir-143 and mir-145, with downregulation of kras2 rreb1 targets accompanying the observed tumor growth inhibition.

26722415_3	our results showed that stc2 protein levels were substantially down-regulated by mir-485-5p .6b. in contrast, inhibition of mir-485-5p led to an increased protein level of stc2 in hcc cells .6d.

19265686_3	these data show that mmp16 is one of the functional downstream target of mir-146b for inhibiting glioma cell migration and invasion.
19265686_4	we therefore measured the mrna and protein expression levels of mmp16 in response to the changes in the mir-146b expression level in u373 cells by pre-146b or lna-anti-146b transfection.
20581857_2	furthermore, the expression of pdcd4 decreased in pc3 cells when mir-21 was ectopically expressed.
20581857_3	on the other hand, silencing of mir-21 increased pdcd4 expression in pc3r cells .
20581857_5	these findings suggest that pdcd4 is indeed a functional targetfor mir-21-induced chemoresistance to docetaxel in pc3 cells.
26801823_1	to verify whether mir-200a or mir-141 may regulate the expression of hlxb9, the dual-luciferase assay was employed.

23338485_2	therefore, we consider that runx3 should be at least one of targetgenes of mir-301a.
23338485_3	thus, the identification of the role of mir-301a as an oncogene through targeting runx3 in gastric cancer helps us to further elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms of gastric cancer development, and could potentially have diagnostic as well as therapeutic value in the future.
